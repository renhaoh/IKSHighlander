I am interested in computers and software coding 	Hardworking	Yes	I felt that my role was important and that others relied on me	Yes	We only succeeded because of teamwork 									We are learning about pollution, also learning about how pollution affects the habitats of animals like fish 	To not give up when we are struggling 
2018/03/11 8:43:25 PM AST	701064	8th	Contaminant	I enjoyed working together with other people in my team to get things accomplished easier.	The easiest part for my job, the deck chief, was securing the guards on the ship and scanning the life forms around us.	The hardest part of the mission was getting everyone on the same page and getting them to all know what was happening. We had a hard time putting our numbers into the keypad when we had to.	I think it could be easier to understand the voices over the intercom and easier to get around the river without running into the sides and seeing where you were going. All of the stations break down very often due to the hacker and engineer too.	8	7	6	Some students did not pay attention to what was being said over the intercom and did not give the numbers we had to input while scanning the water. I could trust my fellow Infinity Knights with keeping the ship and people inside it safe.	We needed to use problem solving skills to figure out how to scan the water and catch the fish. Both took us a while to figure out.	We had to figure out a way to do all of our jobs at once while still helping each other and giving advice to the captain.	Perseverance, bravery, and confidence are all traits that would be very useful during the mission to get it done in time.	5	Communications	No									No	No matter the job, it's still important to try your hardest. Not everything goes the way as planned but you should still give full effort.	I was interested in the hacker because it seemed important yet still challenging.	They would need to think quick and be focused.	Yes	My station was shut down due to the hacker a lot so I couldn't always work with what I needed.	Yes	They all controlled something different yet all things being controlled were important. Without every part under control, the mission could go haywire.	We have been learning about ways to produce electricity and water is one of them. Contaminated water may affect the way water electricity is produced. In class, we also had to try to separate different products from dirty water and get the water clean again.	I learned that working together is a very important thing and everyone has something to do that is critical to the way we work.
2018/03/11 9:27:39 PM AST	421511	8th	Contaminant	I liked the plot of the mission. I found it to be very interesting and I thought that it was similar to what we were learning in class. 	The easiest part of this mission was scanning the water and retrieving the information from it. It was easy to analyze and explain to the operator.	The most difficult part of them mission was traveling in disguise. Some stations were having problems and in order to move, everyone had something to do, so it was difficult to get everyone to work together and work successfully. 	I think the mission could be improved if the training was more like the actual mission. Many things were similar, but some things were left out of the training that was vital for this mission to succeed, so sometimes we were having some problems with our jobs.	9	8	8	Our communications officer helped me tell the operator the results from the water scan, so I know I could rely on them to help communicate with everyone and help me collect information. 	An example of when we had to use problem solving skills during the mission was when we entered the territory where we would have to trespass to gather information. It took the entire crew to stop us from failing the mission. 	It took our crew a while to figure out how to scan the water, so we had to try every possible option in order to learn how it worked. 	A great Infinity Knight must be able to multitask. Every position has multiple components to it, so we all have to be able to balance our priorities. We also have to be confident in ourselves and in our team. We need to be able to rely on one another during the whole mission. Lastly, we have to be diligent and hard working. We all have many tasks to complete during the mission and we have to be able to do them as fast as we can.	5	First Office	No									No	No matter what job I get, I will do it to the best of my ability. I won‚Äôt be disappointed for getting any job because I feel very fortunate to even have the opportunity to do something like this.	I was interested in being an engineer because I was an engineer in 6th grade and I thought it was very exciting and fun. 	If someone had a role like this in the real world, I think they would need to be hard working and must have a clear understanding of their job. 	Yes	I was the captain, so I felt like it was my job to make sure everyone was working properly and if it was not, then I was not doing my job properly.	Yes	Every position was important because they all had something to contribute to the success of this mission and I couldn‚Äôt imagine gown much different it would be if we didn‚Äôt have every position filled.	This mission tied into what we‚Äôre learning in class by using the concept of pollution and diseases. 	Something new that I‚Äôve learned, having completed the mission, is that both humans and animals can suffer from pollution caused by human activity and that it‚Äôs the job of the people to prevent these things from happening. 
2018/03/11 9:59:46 PM AST	421486	8th	Contaminant	Everyone trying to complete it.	Driving down into the water at the beginning.	Trying to avoid the ships that were attacking us in the water.	Teamwork and arguing.	7	6	7	Navigator was trying to be pilot too.	Some tasks were confusing.	When the captain had to figure out what to do.	"Teamwork
Boldness
Confidence "	4	Pilot	No									No	I still had to try my hardest depending on the job.	Captain because they told everyone what to do.	"Responsibility 
Dependability "	No	It isn‚Äôt real life.	Yes	All jobs are important.	Pollution and Teamwork	Contaminated water can do a lot to an area.
2018/03/11 11:35:24 PM AST	1502905	8th	Contaminant	I liked that the mission was more of a challenge than any of the past missions I have done. The mission required us to think and problem solve while having fun.	The easiest part of the mission was understanding the tasks that I had to complete.	The most difficult part of the mission was trying to carry out my tasks while my software was down, since the engineers were busy with other team members.	 I feel that the navigation system could be improved. During the mission, members of my team were having trouble navigating through the water.	10	10	8	In previous missions, others did not communicate well with me and as a result the missions did not go very well. During this mission, the captain did a great job at communicating with me and reporting to me for information.	During the mission, the captain and I were having trouble understanding a set of instructions. We tried many different solutions and eventually found one.	I had to be creative when my software was down. I had to gather information from other team members when I couldn‚Äôt complete my tasks.	An Infinity Knight should be patient, determined, and social.	5	Communications	Yes	Yes	Being able to communicate in the workplace, or with others in general, is a skill many people need that can be helpful.	I was also interested in the doctor and the deck chief. I was interested in the doctor job because I am thinking of going into the medical field in the future. I was interested in being the deck chief because it looked like an interesting job that requires critical thinking to solve problems.	To be successful in these jobs, you must have perseverance, focus, and a good work ethic.	Yes	I was communications, so I felt pressured when I was asked to respond to messages.	Yes	Each job plays a specific role that is needed to run the whole mission. Without each job, we could not accomplish the ultimate goal.									The mission added on to the idea of survival of the fittest, and it tied into the lessons about the way humans that effect the environment.	I learned that with determination, good communication, and teamwork, no job or task is to hard to at least try to succeed in.
2018/03/12 7:47:03 AM AST	701062	8th	Contaminant	My job	The whole beggining 	The very end	The tactical could have more to do	6	8	8	The engineer increased the trust between us by making my ammo and providing me with tools for success	To defeat ships at the end	When enemy‚Äôs were upcoming and I had to destroy them	Respect kindness and to be intelligent 	5	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	Yes	Yes	It was fun	I was also interested in engineer	The ability to act and think fast 	Yes	It was very demanding and it would not be good to fail	Yes	Every job was very crucial in its own way									"The dirty water
Pollution"	There are ways to face dangers like pollution 
2018/03/12 9:07:04 AM AST	421399	8th	Contaminant	I didn‚Äôt like it. I did nothing at all because I was not given directions neither the other data collector	Nothing	Having to sit and watch with nothing to do	Take out the data collector and even split the classes into 2 groups if there are extra people because it is not fun not being able to do anything 	1	1	9	Some people did a good job but also had fun an others didn‚Äôt know what they where doing while I was sitting here doing nothing. Also, some people where messing around	I walked around a little to try to help 	I looked it up on the computer 	Courage, patience‚Äôs, teamwork	5	Communications	No									Yes	Because if you really want something and don‚Äôt get it. It is hard to get it off your mind	Doctor, communications, hacker, mostly everything except data collector 	Social skills	No	I couldn‚Äôt do anything 	No	Some where useless	We have bee learning about global warming and pollution and the mission contributed to the pollution part	Don‚Äôt pick something you don‚Äôt know about
2018/03/12 9:12:34 AM AST	701184	8th	Contaminant	The lure and scare	Going up the river	Fighting the ships at the end	We should not be pounded with ships at the end	8	8	8	The pilot and navigator seemed to not know what to do	When we found the fish	When we found the fish	Trust, the ability to communicate, and the ability to stay calm under pressure. 	5	First Office	No									No	I was still able to do my best either the engineer position	I seemed interested in all leader positions because I like to be a leader	The ability to work with others and communicate	Yes	Every five seconds, something on the ship broke. Especially when we were fighting the enemy ships. 	Yes	The pilot couldn‚Äôt have been successful without the navigator. The two engineers also had to work side by side to figure out what needed fixed. 	We were learning about pollution, so the contaminants in the water showed how it can affect food supply. 	I learned that pollutants can directly affect a food and water source
2018/03/12 12:38:31 PM AST	701084	8th	Contaminant	I liked how we got to save the city from hazardous conditions, and how it helped us with what we are learning in class.	I personally thought that the easiest part of the mission was the water scans because we either had to enter a code or pressurize air lockers.	The most difficult part of the mission was probably defeating the patrol ships at the factory, because the gunner, tactical, kept running out of amo and the engineers couldn't work fast enough, and the pilot couldn't keep the ship pointed at the patrol ships.	I personally think that the width of the river could be fixed because it was very difficult for the pilot to pass through the river without bumping into anything.	9	2	10	when the caption needed information but didn't know how to phrase it he asked the physiologist and she helped him out, and when I as the biologist needed to know what abilities to give the creature the caption gave me great advice.	We had to use problem solving skills while we were fighting the patrol ships because most of the ship was being destroyed and everyone had to help the engineers as much as they possibly could.	when mutating the creature because in different situations it needed different abilities and i had to be creative ass possible to give the mutations it needed.	Communication, success, and courage	5	Biologist	Yes	Yes	Biology is actually something i want to do in the future.	Hacker because I also have an interest in computers.	knowledge on the job and what they are being asked to do.	Yes	Because you want to help out as much as possible.	Yes	we had to keep the ship safe and everyone healthy									we were learning about pollution and power plants.	that any pollution can effect an enviornment 
2018/03/12 2:30:10 PM AST	avery	8th	Contaminant	how we all had to work together 	doing all of the water scans 	scanning the fish 	make it easier to steer because it wasn‚Äôt working for the pilot 	10	9	10	the captain worked well with all of us to help out 	we had to use each other codes to do the water scan so we had to work together 	when helping the others who need it 	"courage

2018/03/12 2:33:54 PM AST	421483	8th	Contaminant	I got more calls and messages then the previous two years.	All of it was easy because I knew what I was doing.	Trying to figure out how to do a water scan.	I think the entire animation could be done better.	5	4	9	The navigator was always yelling at the pilot to do what they already know. 	Trying to hear the captain over everyone yelling over him.	When we could not figure out how to do a scan.	Kindness great hearing and fast to help 	3	Communications	Yes	No	I have done it for 3 years and it is getting boring.	Doctor I had to do that the first year because noone was the doctor.	Fast and efficient 	No	I got used to it 	Yes	Everyone had a job that they did 									Filter water and talk about places that need to filter water 	You can only trust two people you and the captain

2018/03/12 2:36:17 PM AST	701213	8th	Contaminant	Destroying the enemies after being discovered by the Vikasa company	Finding the fish 	Finding out why the river was contaminated 	Lesser warning signals on the screen	5	5	7	Someone releasing a chimera to kill a fish	We had to find out why the fish were gathered near the area	When the enemies came	Wise, Able to communicate well, Can think of a quick solution to the problem 	5	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	Yes	Yes	It was a nice experience	Pilot because I can nagivate well 	Good aim	No	It was a simple task to do	Yes	Everyone played a major role in the mission, and if they were not doing their job well it would also affect the other roles									The fish were under the waterfall because it was fresh water pouring in, and the Sandflies can transmit dieses 	Nuclear waste can make dieses 
2018/03/12 2:36:25 PM AST	701063	8th	Contaminant	I like the fact that we could be easily destroyers by the factories guns it kept the security under high stress and it was fun 	The easiest part of the mission was stopping the hackers for me	The most difficult part of the mission was trying to find the fish to get near the ship and stay with the ship	I think that if we had more time we should be able to close down the factory and be celebrated on by everyone in the city 	7	8	4	Pilot was not good with direction and the navigator was going the wrong speed most of the time	We had to use problem solving skills when we were under attack trying to find the fish	We had to be creative in solving some of the problems such as trying to find where and how the water was in bad condition 	Wisdom, Responsibility, and partnership 	4	Security Chief	Yes	No	I‚Äôm not interested in science or anything affiliated with science 	I would of Been interested in being captain and leading	Leadership is a key to life to be respected 	No	I don‚Äôt feel much pressure doing anything and I‚Äôm pretty sure I did a good job in the mission	Yes	Without anyone of the people doing there jobs we could of easily died quickly and eventually fail the mission									We are learning about how to make water clean and usable and how to figure out problems which we are always doing in class	I learned to be better under pressure and hopefully more prepared if I ever get to use the IKS highlander again 
2018/03/12 2:37:25 PM AST	21hailsn@bwschools.net	8th	Contaminant	I liked when we succeeded 	The easiest part was logging in on the ipads	The most difficult part was when we lost the fish, and had to get them back to our ship.	I think that the mission was done really well, but I think we need clearer information.	10	10	8	One example was when somebody wasn‚Äôt really sure what they were supposed to be doing, and it just made the mission a little bit more difficult to succeed. Something that increased trust between my classmates was when another person helped me at my station and we dealt the situation correctly. 	  When each station needed to be rebooted, like fixed. The captin, engineer, and I worked together to help fix each station. 	I had to be creative when I was trying to figure out what each symbol on the navigators screen stood for.	Kindness, patience, and especially the ability to hear other people‚Äôs ideas.	5	Navigator	Yes	No	I honestly am not interested in being a full time navigator, but I applied for it because I was interested in working with the pilot to hopefully succeed.	I was interested in the role of being doctor. This is because when I graduate high school I would be interested in going into that major for college.	I think you should have the skills to work with others, but also to be a leader. 	Yes	I felt pressure because I was expected to know exactly where to go.	Yes	Everyone played an important role in the mission...everybody was needed.									This mission connects with what we are learning in class because the mission was similar to what we were doing in the classroom. Both lessons had been based around team work.	I learned that listening to what others believe to be the right thing to do is extremely important.
2018/03/12 2:37:39 PM AST	1500755	8th	Contaminant	Everyone had to work together.	Driving around the waters and scanning the water	Getting the fish and trying to teleport back to base.	Action latency can be lowered between the iPads and the main machine.	8	5	8	It helps me increase trust because for example, I was the Gunner and I needed the engineer to give me misses in time to kill enemies.	When trying to kill the enemies as the Gunner.	When I was trying to defend the ship from destroying when defending the fish.	The traits would be brave, intelligent, and experienced.	4	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	Yes	Yes	Because I could join the military and I could be a Gunner for something like a tank.	Hacker	They would have to know alot about the subject.	No	Because all I had to do was to protect the ship.	Yes	Because everyone has a big role in doing their job to succeed.									Because we are learning about waters and that it can be harnful if something happens to like a river or and ocean.	Teamwork is always key to succeed in a mission.
2018/03/12 2:39:11 PM AST	421497	8th	Contaminant	I liked the storyline of the mission the most.	The easiest part of the mission was navigating through the river. 	The most difficult part of the mission was communicating with other stations, in order to fix problems.	There needed to be better communication between stations, and a better understanding of the mission.	4	1	5	I had little trust in my fellow infinity knights, because part of my station was enabled and the hacker did not fix it in a timely manner.	I had to use problem solving during the mission when the crew began getting sick and I had to figure out the reason why.	I had to be creative when making sure no one in the crew got dangerously sick.	Understanding, hard- working, and efficient.	3	Doctor	Yes	Yes	I want to go into the medical field when I am older, so I enjoyed my role as the doctor.	I was interested in the captain role as well, because I I have been told I have good leadership skills and traits,	Intelligent, quick thinking, and kind.	Yes	I did, because I did not the crew would die, and we would fail are mission.	Yes	I do because if someone did not contribute to the mission then they would make it harder for the rest of the crew to succeed.									The fish tied in with our lessons in biology, and and the shortage of food and fish  tied in with our lessons about extinctions.	Communication is key in succeeding at group work.
2018/03/12 2:39:16 PM AST	1501384	8th	Contaminant	I enjoyed the teamwork everyone put in to help one another with their jobs the most.	The easiest part of the mission was handling only 1 job and not being responsible for several jobs.	The most difficult part of the mission was not being able to do my part when the hacker was being hacked.	I think to improve the mission the hacker need to work better so we all can do our jobs.	3	5	8	The doctor helped keep us alive.	When I had to run a bunch of scans on animals. I was the Deck Chief.	Never 	Bravery, hard working, communicative	3	Deck Chief	Yes	No	No because I was absent the day we got to pick jobs.	Communications because I‚Äôve been doing it the last 2 years.	They would need to know what they were doing.	Yes	Yes because if I don‚Äôt do my part the ships closer to not completing the mission.	Yes	Yes because everyone had to do their job or the mission would not get completed.									It tied in with the space lesson we did and the wind turbine project.	I learned that working in something like that would be super hard.
2018/03/12 2:39:49 PM AST	1505874	8th	Contaminant	I Like how we all had to communicate and it was like a crew effort. it wasn‚Äôt just you sit there and do your job and that‚Äôs it. We all talked to each other and all had fun.	The easiest part was driving down the river looking for fish and the problem.	The most difficult part of the mission was having to help the floods the regenerating and all talking to hear the information we had to know because it was kind of hard to hear.	I think we can communicate more and help each other instead of getting upset.	2	2	8	The navigator did really good with saying what‚Äôs happening and doing his job really well. And also the captain he was helping me and everyone else with stuff if they didn‚Äôt know what to do.	When we found out what was making the fish die we really didn‚Äôt know how to solve it.	Doing my job I think because I had to fix dieffrent things and give out codes and had to figure out things to do to help other people.	I think they should be friendly they should be able to communicate and they should be creative 	3	Security Chief	No									Yes	If your really good at computers and you signed up for hacker and you didn‚Äôt get it and then you might‚Äôve got something your not good at.	Pilot because I think it would be fun and interesting to see how it works.	They would have to be really smart 	Yes	Because I don‚Äôt want to be the one who messes it up.	Yes	It‚Äôs not just a one person job we needed everyone 	We have learned about pollution and fish and the environment and how it has to be clean to be able to live 	I have learned that nasty water can kill fish and that it has other affects.
2018/03/12 2:40:22 PM AST	421444	8th	Contaminant	taking photos of the crew and working together 	walking around and taking pictures 	trying to test the water and to get away from the robot in the water 	being clearer with informaton 	6	6	8	trust was increased when we finally tested the water and when we successfully completed the mission	when we had to test the water for the governor 	when we had to get away from the robot in the river 	confidence, friendliness, intelligence 	3	Videographer	Yes	Yes	i love all types of photography and it is very interesting to me 	communications and security guard because i can pay attention when something is needed to be done 	to be good with a camera and have an interest in taking photos 	Yes	i get nervous about everythin and this would be the first time i ran through and actually completed a mission in the simulator 	Yes	everyone had something special about their job that helped the team complete the mission 									we are going to be lesrning about pollution and its effects on the earth 	learning to communicate with my class mates more 
2018/03/12 2:41:24 PM AST	701065	8th	Contaminant	What I liked most about the mission was the enviornment that we were stationed in.	The easiest part of the mission was putting in the numbers into the keypad when we scanned the water.	The most diffucult part of the mission was how fast paced the whole thing was. We were constantly fixing stuff for the mission.	What could be improved would be how we handled the hardships. We were kind of rushing to finish. Also we didn't know how to catch the fish.	5	6	8	The captain and my enginneer partner I could trust because they helped me fix the broken things on the ship when I needed the help.	When multiple tools had to be fixed, that was very stressful. We were rushing to fix everythig in a timely manner.	When me and my partner had to decide who would fix what and when or if we would just do it together.	Bravery, Patience, and Knowledge	3	Engineers	Yes	No	I would not enjoy engineering as a career because it is not something that interests me.	I also seemed interested in the communications because I have never been that job and I thought it would be fun to mix it up a little and try something new.	Very loud and talkative so that the captain can hear all the incoming messages.	Yes	Yes because one second everything was working properly and then in the blink of an eye, two stations were all ready in the orange-yellow stage.	Yes	Every job is critical because they all played a special role in helping the crew find the fish.									The fish were being polluted out of their homes and learning how to filter water without getting an overwhelming amount of pollution.	I learned how difficult it is to enginneer and take care of the whole ship and in a timely fashion.
2018/03/12 2:43:26 PM AST	1500853	8th	Contaminant	I liked the part where we had to communicate with each other. We had to share numbers to each other in order to complete the scan of the water.	The easiest part of the mission would be when we 	The most difficult part of the mission would be when we were being attacked. The ship was so fast and it was hard to defend ourselves.	I think they could improve the communication. I really enjoyed the part when we shared the numbers to complete a scan. I believe they should make more parts where you have to depend on each other for passwords.	5	8	6	The trust was increased when the captain would check on my station or when someone would ask me to fix them( I was the doctor).	At first I did not understand the filter at my station but once I looked at it and analyzed it I understood that I had to cleanse the filter of radiation and other things. 	I had to be creative when fixing a crew member. Their ‚Äúhealth‚Äù would not be normal so I would have to be creative in which medicine I have them. 	They would have to be brave, kind, and hardworking. 	4	Doctor	Yes	Yes	Yes I think I like helping people more and making sure they are not sick. In the future I would even consider becoming a doctor. 	I seemed interested in engineer because they seem like they fix a lot of things and I would very much enjoy that. 	An engineer would have to be smart and a good problem solver in the real world to be successful. 	Yes	If I did not fix someone in certain amount of time their health would keep declining. 	Yes	Yes without certain positions not all of our operations would run smoothly. 									We did a filtration project in class and that tied in with the water. We also learned a lot about organisms this year and that ties in with the fish. 	That team work is very important
2018/03/12 2:45:05 PM AST	421397	8th	Contaminant	I liked how we all worked together and pushed each other to achieve excellence.	The easiest part of the mission was transporting the fish to the other side of the river.	The most difficult part of the mission was for me as the pilot it would not let me steer most of the time and that was very frustrating. I do not know if that was a bug in the system or if it was something that happened during the mission but it ended up hurting my team and how we performed.	I think that the mission would be more explanatory because we had no clue how to get the fish to the other side until we asked the computer, but we did not even know that the computer was even a thing until one of the calls told us about it.	8	5	9	The engineers did not do anything until something went wrong which was very bad because it almost led our ship to break. Also, there were some jobs that yelled at me personally for not knowing how to do my job even though they had no clue how to do theres either.	The navigator and I had to work together to figure how fast we needed to go and to where so she directed me while i drove us to our appropriate place when we needed to be there.	We didnt know that the computer was a thing until mid mission so we had to create our own assumptions about what to do.	Responsible, acceptance, and leadership 	5	First Office	No									No	I got my intial job but i was switched because we did not have enough people therefore i was very understanding and took on my new role.	Doctor because i was it previously and it was a lot of fun and i like to help people.	They would need manors because without them people would not respect you.	Yes	Yes because people yelled at me the whole time and without me they would be lost so that added more pressure towards me.	Yes	Yes because without every person on the mission we wouldnt be able to successfully finish what we needed to.	We learned that teamwork in both the wind turnine and the mission was very important. Also, we had to help each other when we got stuck leading us to learn teamwork skills.	You need to have a lot of teamwork to succeed.
2018/03/12 2:45:09 PM AST	1503637	8th	Contaminant	when the dragon killed flyes	Getting into the sea	Getting red of the flyes	People's health	10	10	7	Increases was when we got red of the flyes,decrease was when people's health was very low.	When the ship got out of the sea.	When we did not know anything about the calling President.	Communication,teamwork,trust	4	Hacker	Yes	No	I chose no because i want to be an engineer.	Biologist because you could tame the dragon.	Good Communication with the People's	Yes	Because i want to do more mission like that	No	I say no because its not like a real mission									I have learing in class how the wind turbans work, how to creat them	The company was not effecting the fish
2018/03/12 2:46:14 PM AST	421428	8th	Contaminant	I liked the feeling when we completed the mission the best because I felt accomplished.	The easiest part was the beginning when nothing was really happening yet.	The most difficult was the end when all of the systems were failing and we were frantically trying to get them fixed. 	I think that the mission could have better picture to make it seem more realistic to have a better experience.	9	7	7	The captain was not always paying attention to what was going on and several people were not at the stations when they should have been.	When all of the systems were failing I had to figure out which was the most important to fix first.	When the systems were failing I had to figure out how to split the work up between me and my partner.	Three traits would be focused, hardworking, and trustworthy.	4	Engineers	Yes	Yes	There are some things I am not as confident with that I want to get better at.	I was not interested in the other roles because I did not think I would like them or have fun doing them.	They need to be able to work fast and stay focused. 	Yes	All of the systems were failing and it is not easy to get them fixed quickly.	Yes	Without one job the whole mission could have failed because everything was needed to complete the mission.									We did a lab about the filtration of water and the water in the mission was contaminated so it tied together in that way.	I learned that the answers always aren‚Äôt right in front of you and you need to work hard to get the task done.
2018/03/12 2:47:05 PM AST	421392	8th	Contaminant	I liked how we worked as a team and helped each other out	The easiest part of the mission was collecting and transferring the fish to the other side of the river 	The most difficult part of the mission was the ship was disabled and our engineers had to work together to get the stealth back up and the other parts 	I think we could have had better team skills as individuals 	9	7	8	the engineers because they worked slower than we needed them to and the communications because she communicated very very well 	Whenever our ship was disabled we had to come up with a way to fix it in a little amount of time 	Whenever the governor called we had to come up with a solution to the question quick if we didn‚Äôt know what the answer was also whenever the fish were the ship flew out of the water and we had to hurry and come up with a way to find the fish again	Responsibility, understanding, teamwork	4	Captain	Yes	Yes	I would like to learn more about this job. I would like to know more background about the mission and figure out a way to remember so I could answer the questions more easily and faster	Engineers because they had a very important task and I thought it would be a fun job and the doctor because I think it would be a very fun job and they had to save all the crew members and it would be very interesting 	Trustworthy, reliable, and responsibility 	Yes	Whenever we had to answer the call and got asked to do something we had to answer and do it very quickly. I felt a lot of pressure doing this job although it was very fun 	Yes	Every one had a specific job that had to be contributed during the mission and would help us succeed 									One example is during the wind turbine is we had to have teamwork and understanding another example would be when we cleaned the water with using rocks and grains we had to have teamwork. 	Something new that I learned having completed the mission is you need a lot of teamwork and responsibility to succeed something 
2018/03/12 2:47:31 PM AST	1500256	8th	Contaminant	I liked the challenge of finding a way to properly communicate with my crewmates while still staying well functioning 	The easiest part of the mission was going downstream to analyze the river	The hardest part was when our ship was spotted and we had to fight the companys ships 	I believe the mission can be sped up a small amount because it goes very slowly at the begging and does not teach much, it could also have less times scanning the river as we did it about 2-3 times	4	4	1	The captain had misquoted the rivers results thus we needed to rescan the ruver again. The pilot had kept stating along wuth other posistions they had no idea what they were doing.	We had started to fight the enemys afyer being caught and i had to manage the power with a very damaged reactor so i had to chose between tactical, engines ,shields or sensors.	We had to figure out a way to catch a fish(we misunderstood the goevenor who had stated they need the fish as we needed to catch them however in reality the govenor genuinely needed the fish for survival), it was very diffucult however i rememberd spotting my tractor beam mode on the versabeam and i told the pilit to point us at the fish and i caught it.	Good listening, communication, leadership. 	5	Physicist	Yes	Yes	Being a physicist may ve very interesting and i believe it could very potentially be something im interested in.	Being an engineer is also very interesting because i love to solve problems and fix things when i can	I believe they would need to be very intelligent and adept at solving problems.	Yes	If i lose focus the entire mission could fail and we may completly lose all power	No	I believe the communications officer was not very important at all as i belive that job is very simple and not extremely important however i may be incorrect as i am not fully aware of the communcators job details.									We were learning how to be creative and work as a team to make a windmill which id exactly lile what we experienced in the mission except instead of making something it was completing our mission together. We also learned how hard water is to filter without proper tools just like the way the river was polluted and it affected the whole town, i have a new appreciation for my water and other gifts.	I learned that waterfalls can produce a fresh water area where even if the water its going into the polluted fish may live healthily in those areas.
2018/03/12 2:48:25 PM AST	au0701211	8th	Contaminant	My job, getting to train the dragons to what the situation needed.	(After finding the fish) Collecting the fish and escaping the heavily contaminated area.	Finding out that we had a ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù that could scan the water, the whole time we were looking for a job that could do that.	Like I talked about above, the team should be told that they have a ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù	4	5	9	When I saw all the alerts on the board, I was concerned that we would fail.	When the water was being scanned, we were asked (each person) to type a code in our keypads. I didn‚Äôt hear it so I had to guess and check from the different jobs.	Same as above.	Intelligent, Kind, and great teamwork.	5	Hacker	No									No	I ended up liking the Biologist a lot.	Tactical and Biologist because they seemed like the ones I would like the most.	For hacker, I‚Äôm guessing the person would need at least some prior experience working with computers or technology. 	No	There weren‚Äôt many deadlines to meet for my position in the first place.	No	Certain jobs (like Biologist) could have been excluded and the mission still could have been a success.	We made filters in-class, which filters out poulluted/dirty water. We also learned about areas that had polluted/undrinkable water.	That we can still turn around the fate of our mission even at the brink of failing.
2018/03/12 2:50:06 PM AST	701126	8th	Contaminant	I liked having to work as a team	the water scans were the easiest because I didn‚Äôt really have to d anything	people gave me different directions a lot so I never knew what to do	the computer told us to do something and once we did yelled at us for doing it	6	3	2	Physicist and navigator were constantly yelling at me for no reason	I didn‚Äôt have to use problem solving skills	I didn‚Äôt need to come up with any creative solutions	they should be careful, comunicative, and brave	2	Captain	No									Yes	I didn‚Äôt know how to do the job I got	I was slightly interested in the doctor because I have done it before and it was interesting	They would need to get straight answers about what to do when they ask questions	Yes	Because if I didn‚Äôt do my job well no one else could do theirs	No	There were a lot of people that just sat there the entire time and didn‚Äôt do anything	It didn‚Äôt tie in very well because we haven‚Äôt learned about habitats yet	I learned that communication is key to getting stuff done
2018/03/12 2:51:52 PM AST	701067	8th	Contaminant	Working my job with my group	The easiest part was when we had the whole ship scanned. I just had to reprogram and tell some people numbers for them to go their job.	The most difficult part was when the mission was at its high point and me,being an engineer, had to work hard and fast to get the jobs done.	They can add more activities like the whole ship being scanned and we all relied on eachother.	8	7	7	My engineer partner and I worked well together to fix all the systems. I did see some people that seemed to not care too much though.	All the systems were going down at one point and when my group was sort of lost.	When all the systems were down we had to split off and work separately to make it work together.	Three personality traits would be to be focused, fast worker and brave.	5	Engineers	Yes	No	It does not interest me	The captin-it seems interesting to tell people what to do	Hard and fast worker	Yes	There were a lot of things that needed to be done and it takes a long time to do them	Yes	We all had important jobs									We were working on filteration systems in class and are going to start to learn about it.	Everyone has to work together for things to work
2018/03/12 3:03:09 PM AST	1500258	8th	Contaminant	working with everyone 	scanning the water 	scanning the fish 	working together better 	10	10	10	when we have to scan the water 	scanning the water 	when we had to help each other fix the issues 	strong, brave, and courageous 	5	Pilot	No									No	i was not in school to pick jobs 	captain because i‚Äôve done it before and i liked it 	good sense of direction 	Yes	i didn‚Äôt want us to lose 	Yes	everyone is important 	people skills and water quality 	how to work well with others 
2018/03/12 3:10:40 PM AST	1502802	8th	Contaminant	I liked the Team concept. 	Holding doors for the crew	Working together with my crew	Communication 	5	3	7	Communications and security 	I had to calm down my crew before coming up with solutions 	When the corporation hacked our ship	Patientce good listening and problem solving 	5	Captain	Yes	Yes	Leadership is something you can use in every aspect of life 	None	He would have to be patient and a good speaker 	No	Because i thought i did pretty good with my job and my work	Yes	Everyone in my team had contributed their most and they all had important roles									The wind turbine and mission tied together with how teamwork skills go together. Also, the water filter had a lot of pressure when it came to the amount of time given and how we had a small team.	That teamwork is important when trying to conplete a task
2018/03/12 3:34:33 PM AST	1504398	8th	Contaminant	I enjoyed the team work.	The easiest part was logging into an ipad.	The most difficult part of the mission was trying to be patient with other classmates.	The mission can be improved with more clear descriptions of the mission.	10	10	8	One example that helped me trust another classmate was when another classmate helped me figure out how to completely function with my station.	I had to use problem solving skills when my engineer wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to give the other stations good power.	I had to be creative when I was trying to figure out how to help another classmate with their station.	Honesty, patience, and being able to work with others.	5	Navigator	Yes	No	I am not interested in being a full time navigator actually. 	I was interested in the doctor because I hope to have a career in helping others.	I think you will need to be flexible with others, and to have patience.	Yes	I did because I wanted to be able to carry my part with 100%.	Yes	Everyone was needed in the mission.									In class we are learning about teamwork and the effects of it, and in the simulator it truly tied into the teamwork part. 	I have learned that patience is key.
2018/03/12 4:22:51 PM AST	421458	8th	Contaminant	What i liked most was bossing people around and working as a team.	The easiest part of the mission was making phone calls.	The most difficult part of the mission was trying to stay undercover.	I think the positions could be improved a little .	8	8	7	I think our communications officer helped increase our trust because he knew what he was doing. I think one of our engineers helped decrease our trust because they didn‚Äôt know what they were doing.	A situation that occurred was when our wifi went our for 2 minutes. Although it wasn‚Äôt apart of our actual mission, we all used problem solving skills and worked as a team to figure out what to do.	We had to be creative when we had to figure out how to call the governor.	leadership, trust, strength 	3	Engineers	No									No	No because i did good as the captain and i felt i was better atthe captain because it helped me with my leadership skills and i may have been the most responsible person on our mission.	Captain because i need to become more of a leader and that position helped me do that.	The skills someone would need is great leadership and great trust build in.	No	No because most of the positions knew what they were doing.	Yes	Yes because all positions had a specific role they need to accomplish and everyone accomplished their goal.	The mission tied in with our science lesson because the mission delt with pollution and that is what we are learning ins cornice class. Another example is the fish. We learned about animals and what they do in our world to help the human environment live.	Something new i have learned is that working as a team can help accomplish many goals.
2018/03/12 6:01:21 PM AST	421507	8th	Contaminant	I liked trying out my new job. It was my first time being security chief. So it was interesting to try something new. 	He easiest part of the mission was to find the fish. We followed instructions and went the right way. Finding the fish was simple. 	The most difficult part was when we tried to defeat the enemy ships attacking us. We had to fight them off and protect our own ship and crew. 	I think that the team could have worked together a little more. We sometimes would yell across the room. Sometimes we didn‚Äôt talk when we needed too. Communication and teamwork could have been improved. 	8	8	9	When I was about to die the doctor helped save me and I survived. Without the doctor I would have died. The captain also led our ship pretty well. Our assignments were completed properly. 	I was responsible for stopping hackers. So I had to get rid of them and set traps to stop them. 	Sometimes I had to decide where to put traps or when to remove them. I also had to decide which one was the best one. 	One personality trait is patience. You have to give you team members time to think and work it out. Another trait is determined. You have to want to complete the mission and succeed. The last trait is kindness. You have to treat your team nicely and respectfully. 	5	Biologist	No									Yes	You had to become known to new experiences and techniques. So it made me a little nervous. I didn‚Äôt want to let my team down. 	I was interested in the doctor role because it might be cool to see how it works for that job. And to try a completely different job. 	They have to be careful and patient. And have steady hands. 	No	I think each job has the same amount of stress. You still have to succeed and help your team. 	Yes	Every job has a special part. For example without a doctor people would start to die and get sick. Without engineers the ship would break. We need all the jobs to keep our ship and crew in tact. 	It showed us how badly pollution can effect our environments and habitats. It can cause sicknesses to spread and species to die off. 	I learned that pollution can cause a chain reaction. It can cause bugs to spread diseases which gets people sick and eventually causes them to die. 
2018/03/12 6:09:53 PM AST	421386	8th	Contaminant	Scanning the water.	Traveling through the stream.	Rescuing the fish after being discovered.	It could be made easier to understand what the current objective is throughout the mission.	7	6	6	The engineers made ammunition for the versabeam.	Running water scans.	"Escaping from the patrol bots.
Granted, the team did appear to fail at that part because we tried to fight the patrol bots."	Good at communicating, observant, and wise.	3	Physicist	Yes	Yes	I would like to understand it better.	I was interested in the engineer position because it serves an essential support role to the team.	They would need to be good at communicating, recognizing high priorities, and using the right tool for a given task.	No	It is a fairly simple job.	No	Some roles simply have little application in most missions.									It involved pollution and the destruction of an ecosystem.	Pollution can be devastating to a civilization.
2018/03/12 6:34:55 PM AST	421499	8th	Contaminant	Completing the mission successfully.	Making the ammo.	The end	The steering that the pilot uses.	4	5	10	I could see what they were doing which would tell me what or what not to work on.(Engineer)	I had to switch a panel to get the right code.	Me being the engineer, I had to chose which spot on the ship to repair out of all of them because I had to do them one at a time.	succession,perseverance,hard working	3	Biologist	No									Yes	You would do better at what you enjoy.	Hacker because I had experience with that job in the past.	Communicating with others. 	No	I could do it all on my own.	Yes	Everyone needed to help in their special way.	It gets us as classmates interact with each other more, and another reason is it gives us problem solving skills.	Teamwork can lead you to success.
2018/03/12 7:30:29 PM AST	1501480	8th	Contaminant	The challenge	The training	When we got upstream	The teamwork 	7	4	1	When the captain didn‚Äôt know what he was doing and when the biologist released his weapon	None	None	Communication.      Teamwork.                   Quick thinking 	2	Navigator	Yes	No	Because it was a simple job that did not require focus	Engineer because they have a lot of work to do that is benificial	A good eye	No	Because it required no skill	No	Because some people didn‚Äôt do there job and we made good progress 									None	Pick a better team
2018/03/12 7:52:13 PM AST	421388	8th	Contaminant	What I liked about the mission the most was the teamwork aspect. We all got to work together to get the mission done and all had an important part that we couldn't have completed the mission without.	What I thought was the easiest part of the mission was the beginning, it was really calm and nothing important was happening really.	What I thought the most difficult part of the mission was trying to communicate with the others because everyone was stressed out and confused so that was challenging part of the mission.	What I think can be improved about the mission is maybe the way some jobs can be more important. I felt like some of the jobs, ex. the physicist, we kinda of important but weren't utterly need for the mission to be successful. I feel like the person who got a job like that could have maybe felt almost excluded or unimportant.	10	7	7	The pilot wouldn't trust me when I said that we were supposed to go a certain way even though we were supposed to go that way.	We had to figure out a way to get to the Upstream the fastest way but there were rocks so we had to go around them	When we had to capture the fish we had to get close to the fish and then extend our Shields.	A great Infinity night would be able to problem-solve, communicate well with others and be cooperative and flexible with their teammates.	5	Navigator	Yes	Yes	I would like to learn more about my role of the Navigator because it was interesting and fun even though I've done it before and it is a very crucial role to the Infinity Knights crew.	I am interested in being the captain because it has more control and needs to work more with its crew.	They would need to be patient, cooperative, Focused and assertive.	No	There wasn't a lot of pressure to meet deadlines or expectations for my position because I had done this role before and was confident in my ability to execute it again within a timely manner.	No	I don't feel like every single one of the jobs contributed that much because for example the physicist and the videographer didn't do that much and I feel like they could have.									The mission tied directly into what we are learning in the classroom because we are learning about pollution and that's what this mission was about.	I learned that people get stressed out very easily over little things and that pollution and toxic waste Etc can have a very harmful detrimental effect on the environment and its inhabitants.
2018/03/12 7:56:20 PM AST	421489	8th	Contaminant	I liked how we had to stay unnoticed by the fertilizer company and swim through the river disguised as a fish to find the actual fish. 	The easiest part of the mission was testing the water. 	The most difficult part was working together to find the fish because everybody was confused and frustrated.	I think the mission could be improved with more information to help us understand how to test the water. 	2	2	5	The trust was decrased between me and my fellow Infinity Knights. This is because the pilot was not acting appropriately and would not stop jumping out of the water into the sky. The pilot also was speeding through the river while we had to go slow and act like a fish. 	During the mission, I had to find out which medicine would be best to give the Infinity Knights that were injured to cure their health. I had to do this quickly and efficiently. 	I had to be creative when solving a problem when there was many people injured and the red and blue tubes were at a critical level. I went back and forth between both screens and in the end, it went well.	An Infinity Knight would have to be great at communicating, working as a team, and must contain listening skills. 	3	Doctor	Yes	Yes	I seemed to balance out the levels of health that I was given easily and it was exciting to know how to help cure others. 	I seemed interested in the engineer because they solved challenging puzzles to collect ammunition and weapons to help the shuttle. 	To be an engineer, you must have the ability to work well with others, enjoy challenges, and communicate. 	Yes	I felt pressure because if I did not cure people in time, they would not be able to function at their position. 	Yes	I feel every job was a critical contribution because each job is beneficial to helping out others. 									This mission taught us about pollution and how the fertilizer company was polluting the river. This mission also taught us that pollution can affect living organisms. This tied in with our class because we are learning about pollution and the affects it has on the world. 	I have learned that pollution can occur anywhere and be created by almost anything. 
2018/03/12 8:46:32 PM AST	421438	8th	Contaminant	I liked that I got to communicate a lot with my team members because in 6th grade I didn‚Äôt get to as much.	The easiest part of the mission was calling people to let them know information.	The hardest part of the mission was decrypting messages.	I think I could‚Äôve decrypted messages faster.	8	6	6	It was hard to communicate with the hacker because I needed his number and he was quiet.	I had to learn how to decrypt messages by making the waves the same exact thing.	I had to be creative by listening to the governor of Sandura City and think of how to fix things.	Trusting, hard-working, and helpful.	4	Communications	Yes	Yes	I want to communicate more and send messages.	I was interested in doctor because I could help people survive.	Understanding, quick, and helpful.	Yes	Yes because I had to communicate with everyone and it was hard with multiple people at once.	Yes	Yes because we had to call the governor and he told us where to go.									We have been learning about overpopulation and pollution. The Contaminant mission was about resources and how to get them.	I have learned to communicate more with other people.
2018/03/12 9:45:16 PM AST	1503634	8th	Contaminant	I liked doing the station.	The easiest part was advising the engineer.	The most difficult part was during the fight when all the systems went down and the engineering camera was moving too slowly.	I think that you could do multiple classes at a time so you always have enough people at a time. Not to base it off of a class at a time but to get the perfect amount of people at a time.	8	5	6	The navigator arguing with the tactical all the time. (Decrease)	I had to figure out how to keep the ship running.	I had to find a way to get the levels of the machines to a good level and had to communicate with the other engineers.	"Patience 
Authority
 Understanding
"	4	Doctor	No									No	Because I know to do my job the best even if it isn't the one I wanted.	Doctor and Engineer because they are interesting to work.	They would need education in math and different types of building.	Yes	Because i was being yelled at to go faster.	Yes	Because we needed all the people to do all the difderent parts of the mission	It way about the environment and about renewable resources.	I learned that the engineering job is hard
2018/03/12 9:52:58 PM AST	701099	8th	Pandemic	The team work and communication 	Waiting for my part as biologist to come into play	Figuring out which genes to put into the chimera	If the crew doesn't have enough time carry it over to another class after crew b finishes	8	6	4	1. The captain came over to check on everybody's stations 2. How the doctor checked in and fixed my vitals 	"When the crew has to check the water levels
"	Whith the fight at the end I had to figure out how to get the right genes for the task	Outgoing kind and communicated 	4	First Office	Yes	No	The role is different from the simulator 	"First officer because it is 
Almost a mixture of all of the roles
"	Teamwork 	Yes	Became we only had till the end of the period 	Yes	Roles that were critical else we would have died or failed									How humans impact the environments and how we destroy food supplies 	Teamwork with the gunner or tactical 
2018/03/13 8:27:11 AM AST	1502962	8th	Contaminant	I liked the storyline. 	Responding to emergencies. 	Working together as a team	Less directions 	5	2	1	There was a lot of bickering and unnecessary conversation 	When I did the emergencies 	 Figuring out how to scan the water 	Good listener, efficient, and smart 	2	Doctor	No									No	Because it wasn‚Äôt a lot of work 	I was interested in the engineer because they worked hard 	They would need to be creative and intelligent 	No	Because it could be completed quickly 	Yes	All the jobs were important to succeed 	It had to do with different types of pollution and how it affects the environment like we learned in class 	Factories can affect waterways 
2018/03/13 8:28:39 AM AST	421416	8th	Contaminant	I liked the storyline, it was unique.	The easiest part was responding to the emergencies. 	The hardest part was working quickly.	I think my team could have improved by working faster.	8	7	7	The hacker helped me find which button to push during the scan, which increased my trust in my team.	I had to use problem solving skills while helping my fellow crew members.	I had to be creative when answering the questions. 	An infinity knight should be quick, hardworking, and creative.	4	Physicist	No									No	I was honestly happy with doing any job.	The doctor and videographer roles interested me because i thought i would be good at them and already had experienced.	They would need to be good at communication and multitasking. 	No	My job was fairly easy.	Yes	People work better as a team.	We have been learning about population and global warming in our science class, this mission was also about human caused pollution, so it tied in well.	I learned that fish are more dangerous than you‚Äôd think.
2018/03/13 9:13:13 AM AST	1502164	8th	Contaminant	Doing my job	the easiest part was working with others	trying to take down the ships that were attacking us	i think we could have been more calm	7	7	9	when we needed each others information, and when we were helping eachother 	to find why the fish were gone	when we found the fish	helpful, polite, and understanding	4	Doctor	No									No	i liked the job i got	communications, i like talking to people	understanding and communicative	No	i did my best	Yes	everyone needed do do the best at their job to succeed 	pollution	i learned teamwork

2018/03/13 10:03:17 AM AST	701095	8th	Contaminant	I liked that all the jobs had a lot to do.	The easiest part was getting the fish to follow us.	Th hardest part was to take the scans.	It could be longer.	7	7	9	The doctor almost killed people and the engineers were taking a long time to repair things.	we used them when we all had to do the scans.	When we had to find a way to get past enemies.	cooperation, determination, and patience	5	Doctor	No									No	I was happy just to be apart of it.	I was interested in the engineer because they were always busy.	They would need intelligence and patience.	Yes	I did not want to lose the mission for my teammates.	Yes	We all had different tasks to complete.	It involved sources of pollution and what the pollution will be like.	I learned that teamwork is key.
2018/03/13 10:03:28 AM AST	1501584	8th	Contaminant	When we had to fight the enemy patrol ships. 	The scans of the river.	When we had to get the fish downstream.	Make it easier to defeat the enemy ships. 	8	8	9	We had to finish our scans but people were getting confused so me and physician went around and helped people get codes and finish the scan faster.	When we were fighting the viska corporation and we ran out of power I had to constantly repair the ship to make sure we had power. 	When we had to get the fish to follow us downstream we used our shields to trap them. 	Charisma, Confidence, Bravery 	5	Biologist	No									No	It did not effect my job, i think i performed just as well as i would've with the biologist job. 	Biologist and gunner because I did them in the past and I know how to use them. 	They would have to know how to communicate with their team and think together to solve the problem. 	Yes	Yes, because everyone relied on me to get the power running so they had computers to use, without me they wouldnt be able to use their station. 	Yes	Yes because working together is crucial and everyone relies on each other to do their job. 	We are learning about global warming and pollution which ties into the pollution by the viska corporation. We also did a lab on diluting water. 	Yes, that teamwork is important.

2018/03/13 12:36:12 PM AST	701054	8th	Contaminant	i liked how our group all worked together.	The mission was not very easy at all. however the easiest part would have to be when we were all working together.	Being able to stay calm and work together whenever we were failing the mission.	I think there should be better direction, for example we did not know how to communicate to Mrs.Reynolds so it was difficult when the computers were rushing us.	8	8	6	Some people were rushing other people, when they were trying their best.

2018/03/13 2:19:41 PM AST	421411	8th	Contaminant	I liked when my crew got to the point in the mission when we had to defend ourselves from the security ships in the river the most. It was very stressful, but that is what made it fun.	The easiest part of the mission was the beginning when we got in the river and started to head upstream towards where we thought the fish would be. All we had to do was keep ourselves in control and not hit the rocks along the sides of the river. Also, there was nothing that was putting pressure on us at that time.	The most difficult part of the mission was the last ten minutes because that was when we found the fish and had then follow us upstream. Then we started to find the barrels and pipes that were contaminating the water. Once we got to that part of the river, we ran into the security ships. They were shooting at us and we were shooting at then, but they hit our ship more than we hit theirs. This caused problems with the ship and our technology. We finally destroyed them and went back downstream to return the fish. It was extremely stressful, but we managed to conquer it.	I think there should have been more security ships towards the middle of the mission to keep it more intense. I think this would improve the mission, and make it more fun.	9	9	9	The Hacker in my crew would always get up during the mission from his/her station to try and do my job. He/She would try to help others, and I appreciated the team effort, but I did not have the trust for the Hacker since he/she was never in the Hacker station. I was doing my job; going around the room helping everyone I could, and the Hacker was always up away from the station. It really frustrates me, and I lost trust in my Hacker. Other than that, I had full trust in my crew because they would call me if they needed help, and they would help each other form their own stations.	During the mission we had to use problem solving skills when we were running out of oxygen. Because we running low, we decided to make up some time with more speed. For example we had 5% of our oxygen left, and we had to get the fish back downstream. We made the ship go a little faster in order to make up for lost oxygen. 	We had to be creative during the mission to solve a problem when we were trying to defend ourselves from the security ships. We were running low on oxygen and on our technology resources. 	Infinity Knights would have the traits determined since they never quit no matter what the situation is, positive because they cannot be negative in bad situations, and collaborative since every Infinity Knight has to work together.	4	Pilot	No									No	I do not think getting the job I first wanted affected how I performed my occupation for the mission because no matter what job I would have gotten, I would have put 100% of my effort into it. I liked my job as the captain more than when I was the pilot in the past missions. Also, it allows people to learn about different jobs that could actually become an occupation they would like to do in the future.	I found the communicator‚Äôs job interesting because he/she could contact the governor for the captain, and he/she got mail to help our crew succeed. I also found the engineering jobs to be interesting because if something was broken, it was up to them to find a way to fix it or create something new.	As the Captain of the crew for the Contaminant mission, I feel that leadership was the most important quality of the Captain. I had to communicate with everyone, help fix problems, and take responsibility for everyone‚Äôs actions. These qualities will help in any form of leadership jobs in the real world. 	Yes	I felt pressure throughout the mission as the captain because I knew that if we did something right or wrong it would be all on me. That is why I put the Captain as my second job request. I feel that I work good under pressure and could work great with my crew members. I found the role of the Captain to be extremely fun!	Yes	I feel that every occupation in the mission was crucial to our success because in the end we all had to work together in order to move the ship, fix the ship, defend ourselves, and bring the fish back where they belong. Every job could have made our mission fail or be a success.	In class, we have been learning about pollution. We have talked about how pollution can cause diseases or sicknesses that can cause death. Also, we talked about how people can fix pollution problems in order to save lives. In the mission, we were looking for the pollution that was causing people to get sick from the bugs spreading the pollution‚Äôs diseases. That is why the Infinity Knights were called into action, so they could help solve the pollution from spreading dieases through the sand flies. We had to find the source and report it, so people could stop it to save people from getting sick.	I learned from the mission that just finding the source of pollution/contamination can help everyone survive. For example, we found the problem, but we did not fix the contamination problem. By finding it though, we can alert people to help stop the problem and hopefully save thousands to millions of people‚Äôs lives.
2018/03/13 2:40:25 PM AST	701089	8th	Contaminant	I liked flying through the river. 	Scanning the river was the easiest part of the mission.	The most difficult part of the mission was destroying the enemy ships.	I think the river should be more detailed. 	5	3	7	I was the hacker. I disabled enemy ships' engines. It helped the tactical aim at them and destroy them faster. It increased trust between us.	I had to use problem solving skills to distribute the computer capacity to the different computers. I had to make sure all of them were sufficiently charged and working.	I had to be creative when I was hacking into enemy ships. They had robots that would ruin my connection. I had to avoid and go around them to disable the ships' engines. 	An Infinity Knight has to be trustworthy. His team should be able to rely on him to do his job. An Infinity Knight must be courageous and keep going in the face danger. Lastly, an Infinity Knight must be kind so that his team will respect him and trust him on the mission.	4	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	No									No	My second choice was to be a hacker, and I got it instead of being a tactical. I had been a hacker twice already, so I knew how to do my job.	I was interested in being a tactical because I thought it would be fun. 	I think that a hacker needs to be patient because they have to wait for the computer to reboot or for their computer to hack an enemy computer.	No	My job wasn't difficult or stressful. Most of the things that I had to do involved waiting.	Yes	All of the jobs did something to help us move forward in the mission.	In our class, we are talking about pollution and how it impacts the environment. We also talked about pollution destroying ecosystems.The mission talked about pollution in a river and its dangerous effects on the fish population. The simulation showed us an example of what we are learning about.	I learned how to work with my team to complete a task. We had different jobs, but we all worked towards the same goal.

Equaling out how much power to give to the others parts of the ship. 	When I was hacking by the system, I had to be creative and hide from the enemy‚Äôs security.	Smart, understanding, helpful 	3	Hacker	Yes	No	Because I‚Äôm not interested in hacking other systems. 	Doctor, because I like helping people and doing my best to save them. 	Quick decision maker, smart 	Yes	Because I had never done that specific job	Yes	Because everyone has their own duty and if one person doesn‚Äôt do their job then we all fail. 									It taught me the effects of bad and contaminated water in the word and it also taught me  how we as the people are ruining our water. 	Our actions have ruined and still is running our environment Android if we don‚Äôt do something fast then we might have to face the punishment that the environment gives us.
2018/03/13 6:04:57 PM AST	421398	8th	Contaminant	I enjoyed working together with my crew to attempt to complete the mission. This was my favorite part of the experience.	In my opinion, the easiest part of the mission was supplying my tactical officer with ammunition. As a team, the easiest part was scanning the water for pollution levels and other measures.	The most difficult part of the mission was attempting to escape the enemy ships from the river. Most of our ship was damaged and it was a challenge to get out of the situation.	I believe that scanning the water took slightly too long. The mission would be better if this time was shortened.	8	7	8	When each position had to give each other codes, we had to communicate together as a team and trust that each position entered the correct code.	There were multiple systems on the ship that were damaged and needed repaired. I fixed the more important systems first, and the less important systems afterwards.	We had to be creative when we found the fish in the river. We had to figure out how the fish were surviving in this location, and my team decided that they were receiving fresh water from a running source. This was a creative idea because we had to "think outside the box."	Patient, Understanding, Problem-Solver	4	Engineers	Yes	Yes	I enjoyed participating in this role in the mission, so I would enjoy doing this in the future.	I was interested in the Hacker role, because I am experienced with computers and technology.	A person in this position in real life would need to remain calm and patient with their occupations.	No	I did not feel pressured, because I knew that my team would understand if somebody made a mistake. I was not worried about making an incorrect decision.	Yes	I believe this because everyone had an important role to play in the mission, and since we successfully completed the mission, everyone on the ship did their job perfectly									In class, we are learning about pollution and what the side effects are of it. We had to explore a polluted river in the mission. In class, we learned about ecosystems and what animals need to survive. We learned how the fish were able with fresh water in the mission.	I learned that pollution can eventually sicken and kill many people, and it needs to be stopped immediately.
2018/03/13 6:55:49 PM AST	701098	8th	Contaminant	It was my first mission, so I had never been in there, but my favorite part was the ipads. 	The easiest part of the mission was going down into the water. 	The most difficult part of the mission was trying to communicate with everybody. 	I think our communication could be improved. 	3	2	8	The captain was loud and aware of his or her surroundings, so we could clearly hear directions. 	We had to fight off the enemies, so we had to figure out have to make them leave. 	We had to be creative when the Vecassa company saw us in the water because we had to be less noticeable. 	A great Infinity Knight should be prepared, creative and aware. 	4	Biologist	Yes	Yes	It seems interesting, and I like working with living things. 	The role of captain would be interesting because you get to lead everybody. 	A captain would need to be loud and trustworthy. 	Yes	You always want your mission to come out as successful. 	Yes	We needed all of the positions because we all worked as a team. 									This mission was on pollution and sicknesses. We are learning about the effects of pollution, and we are learning about sicknesses and diseases our population can face in the near future. 	I learned that teamwork can make you victorious. 
2018/03/13 7:34:39 PM AST	421457	8th	Contaminant	I liked watching everyone work together to have a successful mission.	I don‚Äôt believe there was an easiest part compared to other parts.	The most difficult part, for my job was to get rid of the hacker.	I think having more communication would be helpful.	5	3	3	Everyone had different jobs to focus on so it was hard to trust everyone else when you had to do your own thing.	When the hacker came in.	When the hacker came in.	friendly, hardworking, intelligent 	3	Engineers	No									No	I am good at any job I do.	It did not matter to me what job I got. I work hard at any job.	A person would have to be able to communicate with a team.	No	I knew what I had to do, and I did it.	No	Some jobs did more than others and not all were needed.	The whole scenario was what we were learning in class.	That working as a team gets the job done.
2018/03/13 7:58:48 PM AST	1503311	8th	Contaminant	Working with my team	My job was kind of the easiest part of the mission, well to be honest everything was pretty easy because we worked together as a team 	The ship would crash a lot 	 Navigator 	9	9	8	Towards the the end of the mission everyone was panicking, which decreased the truth weather we are going to pass the mission or not.	I don‚Äôt know	Well I don‚Äôt know, I just had to be calm and patient with the problems going on there	Truth on each other, compassion, and self truth.	5	Doctor	No									No	No, because no matter what job you get, your main focus should always be that you are going to get the job done and you are going to do it right!!	First officer, because I had done that job before and it seemed fun.	They have to believe in their self ( self trust) and compassion.	Yes	I wanted to know what would my position be and yeah...	Yes	Yes, because it does not depend on one person, everyone has to work together and everyone‚Äô Job is important, and everyone holds a important position in mission, without the crew or the team the mission would had impossible.	We are learning about pollution, global warming and all the needs for us human beings needs to live in earth and the same thing was going in the mission we did 	Every job in the world is something not nothing , even working with the person you don‚Äôt like won‚Äôt hurt you, it‚Äôs always the best thing to do, work as a team 
2018/03/13 8:58:33 PM AST	rd0421481	8th	Contaminant	I liked being the Doctor and trying to find the fish.	The easiest part of the mission was the scans. 	The most difficult part was trying to watch everyone and keep them healthy when they all got sick at the same time.	I think we need to have more time to complete the mission and the instructions on what we need to do to operate our stations could be improved and have more guidance. 	9	9	8	I saw that the Deck Chief continued to solve problems and watch out for our ship as they came in which helped increase my trust. However, the hacker was very slow at restoring mine and other jobs' storage space which worried me a lot.	When the Navigator did not have information he needed to help and guide the Pilot, we all communicated to help him and continue to travel safely down stream.	I do not know of any times I had to be creative in coming up with a solution.	"Vocal/Communicative 
Creative
Calm"	4	Doctor	Yes	No	It seems very interesting, but I do not like the responsibility of having someone's life in your hands. However, I loved my job on the mission.	I was interested in Gunner and Navigator because I have never been gunner and I feel that I would be better navigating today rather than 6th grade.	Communicator, Cautious, and Patient	Yes	If I did not cure my patient in time, they could die.	Yes	Yes because every job helped one another and contributed to finding the fish and why the plague was spreading.									The river was polluted and contaminated which caused serious problems for the town. The pollution caused illness and a toll on the enviornment around it. In science we are learning about pollution and the negative effects it has on the world. 	I learned that pollution can cause way more than dirtiness and bacteria, but it can have way more serious effects. 
2018/03/13 9:50:49 PM AST	934108	8th	Contaminant	What I enjoyed most about the mission was the human pollutant theme.	The easiest part of the mission (for me) was repairing the ship while it was not under physical attack.	The hardest part of the mission (for me) was repairing the ship while it was under attack.	I think the mission can be faster-paced, as much time spent is swimming through the river.	8	5	9	Engineer 1 communicated with me often to determine who will repair what so we do not repair the same thing when unnecessary. 	I input numbers from biologist (I think) to help scan the waters. 	We had to be creative when fleeing from the enemies and locating the fish by finding a speed that was fast but did not make the pilot crash in the riverbed. 	A great Infinity Knight needs to be patient, cooperative, and optimistic.	4	Engineers	Yes	Yes	I enjoy the concept of engineering.	I was interested in the biologist because biology intrigues me.	I believe an engineer would need to be analytical and creative.	Yes	If I did not repair, many systems may collapse and compromise the mission.	No	If your group did not accidentally call Vishka Corporation like mine did, the tactical and biologist would have little impact.									Human pollution and human ecological impacts.	I have learned the existence of sand flies and the threat of the Chandipura virus.

2018/03/13 10:41:17 PM AST	701143	8th	Contaminant	I liked the story the most about the mission.	The easiest part of the mission was communicating with my team because there were not a lot of us. 	The most difficult part of the mission was hacking enemy computers.	I think the enemies could have been easier to beat because we almost failed the mission a couple of times.	9	9	8	One example that decreased my trust was that the navigator and pilot sometimes talked about stuff that was not about the mission.	I had to use problem solving thinking when I had to divide the energy into equal amounts to give to my team mates computers.	I had to be creative when coming up with a solution when I was hacking computers and I had to use different routes to not get caught by enemy computers.	An Infinity Knight should be daring, smart, and have quick-thinking.	4	Hacker	Yes	Yes	I do want to learn more about it because it was fun to do.	I was interested in the biologist job because you got to create a dragon and send it out to defeat enemies.	I think the person in this job would have to know exactly what to do and when to do it because they cannot mess up a job like that.	Yes	I did feel pressured because I did not want to mess up for my team or be the reason we did not complete the mission.	Yes	I do believe every job is critical because they all help each other. For example, the pilot would not be able to move without the navigator giving them speed.									We are learning about disease and pollution in class and we learned about that in the mission.	Something new I have learned is that a new disease can develop very fast because of water pollution.
2018/03/14 12:47:36 AM AST	701058	8th	Contaminant	I got to be the biologist.	Scanning the water.	Learning how to take scans of the water.	Better team work and more time to complete the mission.	8	1	1	Nobody communicated well and the navigator sped the ship up at an unbelievably fast rate.	Learning how to scan the water.	I didn't have a chance to be creative. (Bad teamwork!)	Good communication skills, responsibility, and previous experience with the job.	1	Biologist	Yes	Yes	I'm currently interested in biology.	Captain: I believe that I display strong leadership when the chance is given.	I'm a strategic and a tactical thinker.	No	I didn't get the chance to complete the mission. :(	Yes	Not everybody was good at their job.									"We had to cleanse ""polluted water"" as best as we could and have the most clean water remaining.
Environmental factors can affect population growth."	How humans effect on the environment affects population growth.
2018/03/14 7:08:39 AM AST	1501744	8th	Contaminant	i liked the whole experience 	answering the calls	finding the fish	better communication 	7	7	5	when a person wasn't doing their job	we hade trubbel spaning the water	when we were attacked	hardworking calm and nice	4	Communications	Yes	Yes	because communication is a good skill to have	the gunner because i play a lot of video games	they should be polite 	Yes	because they should 	Yes	i think all jobs were important because its a team effort 									it was about how water pollution effects the environment 	i learned that working tougher is important 
2018/03/14 9:11:39 AM AST	1503677	8th	Contaminant	I liked how we all worked together even when it started to get stressful.	When we where just driving in the water to look for anything weird i did not have to do anything during that.	once we got close to the site that was leaking the chemicals in it got harder to complete the mission	the person who was doctor, when we where in the middle of something really important that is when they took the scans. Also the captain because everyone else had to tell them what to do.	8	8	3	My trust decreased when the captain had no idea what to do the entire time.	When me and the hacker started to lose power and we both had to figure out a way together to get it back up and working for each place.	When me and the hacker started to lose power and we both had to figure out a way together to get it back up and working for each place.	Honor Compassion and Strength 	3	Hacker	No									No	My job worked closely with the hacker and i liked what i got it was interesting. 	Doctor because that is one of the job professions i would like to go into	they would need to be concentrated and organized. 	Yes	because you are under pressure for every job that you get and i had to give the limited power we had to different parts of the ship without not giving enough to one part and turning it off.	Yes	because you need every job to complete the mission. 	It showed the effect we had to the envorment 	it is worse than we thought
2018/03/14 11:34:21 AM AST	421412	8th	Contaminant	I liked the intensity of the mission 	The easiest part of the mission was being first officer telling everyone what to do. 	The most difficult part of the mission was making sure everyone was listening and doing what they were suppose to do. 	It could have lasted a little longer	8	7	8	Engineer and doctor didn't follow through with what they were told to do the first time. 	The security chief needed problem solving skills to complete their tasks	Whenever we were looking for the fish we had to ask the computer different creative questions. 	Communication, good listening, dedication	4	Engineers	No									No	Its only a job that doesn't require experience.  	engineer because i like doing different tasks 	They would need to have good leadership and a loud motivated voice. 	No	it was only a small mission. 	Yes	we completed the mission so everyone did good	we were learning about global warming and the earth along with plotion and the water was polluted. 	There were oils from different run off killing the fish and its harmful
2018/03/14 3:49:15 PM AST	1500235	8th	Contaminant	I liked how the mission took place in a river. It made it different from last year‚Äôs mission. 	The easiest part of the mission was when we had to swim upstream. 	The most difficult part of the mission were the water scans because we all had to enter information from each other. 	I think the missions can be improved by adding other animals in the river that we have to find. 	9	6	3	Our navigator did not seem to know what he/she was doing, and they werent paying much attention to the job he/she needed to do during the water scans. Our captain was very good, especially with talking in the phone with the governor. 	We had to use problem solving skills when figuring out how what was causing the disease. 	We had to be creative when we were trying to figure out how to swim upstream with out being noticed. 	An Infinity Knight needs confidence, because if they are doubtful then they won‚Äôt communicate their ideas. An Infinity knight needs to be smart, because there are times we have to figure out how to do tasks. An Infinity Knight needs to be positive, because if they don‚Äôt want to be there, then they won‚Äôt be helpful. 	4	Doctor	No									No	Because I still need to complete the tasks given to me on the mission no matter what job it is. 	Captain because I feel comfortable being in charge. 	A Captain on a plane or ship needs to be alert to their surroundings and helpful. 	Yes	Yes, because I was the communications officer so I had to let the captain know when we got messages. 	Yes	Yes, because those jobs are all there for a reason. If a job was useless, it wouldn‚Äôt be an option. They are all important. 	We have been learning about kinds of pollution in class, and there was pollution causing the water. Also, we only had a certain about of power which goes with us learning about electricity. 	I learned that water pollution can cause serious diseases.

2018/03/14 5:56:06 PM AST	929063	8th	Contaminant	I personally enjoyed the part where the team was asked to scan the river the most.	I believe that the easiest part of the mission was finding the fish.	The most difficult bit of this mission was when our team was caught and was attacked by several enemy ships.	I believe that by adding landmarks in the river would make navigating through the river much easier.	1	1	10	I gained trust when our team was navigating the river smoothly and everyone was helping the mission run as effortlessly as possible. I began to lose trust when we could not figure out how to complete the scanning of the river and when we could not tell which section of the river we were in.	I had to use problem solving skills when the camera I was using ran out of storage. I solved this problem by attempting over and over again to get it to work. Eventually, I got four very low quality pictures.	I had to be creative when I was trying to get the camera to work. I did this by trying to deceive the camera by exiting out multiple times.	I believe that a great Infinity Knite should have openness, persistence, and should be trustworthy.	3	Pilot	No									No	I believe that even though I did not get my role I wanted I still attempted to take good pictures, but unfortunately the camera was out of storage.	I would be interested in manning the role of engineer. This is because it would be something completely new compared to my previous roles and I think it would be fun to be a critical element of the ships operations.	I believe that some one who would be an engineer in th real world would need to have a heavy knowledge on science, math, and drawings.	No	I did not because I observed that others before me had already supplied video and photo material.	No	I believe that the videographer was not a critical element because the mission does not need photo material to be successful.	This mission tied into what we are learning in class by demonstrating the real effects of pollution in our environment and how one simple careless act can throw off an entire ecosystem and economy.	I learned from this mission that not everything you do can work out in the end and sometimes the only answer is acceptance.
2018/03/14 6:52:36 PM AST	421490	8th	Contaminant	I liked working with my class as a team and completing our mission successfully.	The easiest part of the mission was doing my own job because i am experienced and knew what i was doing thanks to prior years.	The most difficult part of the mission was communicating with some of my team mates during emergency situations.	The only problem we had in the mission was that it crashed a couple times.	7	7	5	the pilot crashed our ship	Security  guard 1 did not know what to do and I had to help her.	There was not a time when I had to do that	Responsible, flexible, and reliable	4	Doctor	No									No	Because i still liked the job I received because I have done it before and it was fun.	I was also interested in being pilot because it seemed fun , but you also have to be very responsible	alertness and reliableness 	Yes	when the hackers came I had to get rid of them as quickly as I possibly could.	No	videoographer and biologist did not seem all that critical because the biologist just sat there and did nothing	we were taught about filtration and contamination 	contaminated water kills both people and animals
2018/03/14 7:03:27 PM AST	701134	8th	Contaminant	I liked how it looked like we were in actual water.	The easiest part was luring the fish.	The hardest part was at the end when we were ambushed.	The speed of making energy to make ammo and computer capacity.	9	8	10	"The captain stood by us and did well during water scans.
The Security Chief did well manning three jobs."	I had to decrypt messages and fix things in Deck chief.	I had to find out what to do when Vakasa found us.

No	I believed I worked well during the mission.	Yes	Our mission was a success.									"1. We are learning how pollution ties in with climate change.
2. We did a lab to clean water."	We learned how water pollution can harm ecosystems.

I think the storyline if you completed it or failed it afterward showing your affect on the world.	3	7	3	The navigator stopped and didn‚Äôt know how to start. Another one is the navigator and tactical were arguing.	When we didn‚Äôt know how to scan the water.	We called the dream flint crew for information on how to do it.	Respectful, Knowledgeable, and  you have to pay attention.	4	Pilot	Yes	No	There is too much pressure in real life. I don‚Äôt want to be the person responsible for ending a life.	The hacker because I like to code.	They need to understand what they are supposed to do.	Yes	I am a very important role and dint want to mess up for the team.	Yes	Every job is doing something at some point in the mission.									We are learning about cancer and how it forms and it dies into diseases. We are also just learning about pollution which is another cause of the diseases.	I have learned that diseases can be carried or harmful to the water.
2018/03/15 2:06:39 PM AST	421450	8th	Contaminant	I liked trying to find the fish.	The easiest part was in the beginning when I did not have much to fix.	The most difficult part was near the end when the ship was being heavily damaged and it was hard to fix everything in time.	I think that it moves a little to fast for certain jobs, especially the engineer job. It should probably be fixed to fit every job.	9	6	8	It decreased my trust when, near the end, many thing were happining at once and the captain did not really know how to handle the situation. It increased my trust when the rest of the team helped him out by giving him as much information as they could.	We had to use communication when trying to find the new water source. We had to tell our position.	We had to find a way to get the fish to follow us. 	One would be social. You have to be social with your teammates to succeed   (Must have communication skills). You also need to be responsible for you to complete your job. Last, you must be calm. You have to be calm and cooperative to be able to work as a team.	5	Engineers	Yes	Yes	I believe that I could be a good fit for this job if I keep working at it.	I liked the doctor role. I have an interest in medical subjects and I think that I could succeed at that job.	They need to be able to communicate with their coworkers and be able to work effectively.	Yes	It was hard to fix everything on the ship with only a small amount of time to do it. The process was slow.	Yes	By working together, all jobs contributed to the success. It would make the job difficult if a few jobs were missing.									It had to do with global warming and how it affects many lives and the environment. It also shows pollution from the factories and what it does to animals like fish.	Teamwork is key when working in such a big group like the one we were in during the mission.
2018/03/15 6:51:03 PM AST	421443	8th	Contaminant	Working together with my classmates to solve a problem.	Making ammo was the easiest part.	Keeping all the ships systems working and fixing them was hard.	If we had more time and the mission was longer.	9	10	9	When we had to do a scan everybody listened to what they had to do and responded by getting it done, which boosted my trust with my fellow workers.	Since I was the engineer, everytime I had to complete the pattern sequence I used problem solving skills.	When we were trying to get ideas on our next move if we got stuck.	"1. Honor 
2. Compassion 
3. Strength "	5	Engineers	Yes	Yes	I like the challenge	Captain because I like to be a leader 	To be a captain you need confidence and intelligence  and work with a team well. But to be an engineer you need to also be intelligent but be able to problem solve and work hard.	Yes	Yeah because if systems of the ship were getting broken down and not fixed that's on me.	Yes	Teamwork makes the dream work. Without it you can't accomplish all your goals and challenges you will face.									Both this in this mission and in class we have been discussing the side effects of pollution. And this is a prime example. Also we have been talking about changing to help the world and in this mission we are trying to help the environment.	I have learned that when you work by yourself you get something done, but when you work as a team you get can accomplish way more than anything you could do by yourself.

Yes	everyone has a job and everyone has something to do that is helpful to the mission	"it was about pollution and how it can cause people to get sick
it was also about radiation"	pollution can cause people to get sick or starve
2018/03/16 7:49:57 AM AST	421469	8th	Contaminant	I like the plot like me behind the mission. I think it tied very well into what we are learning. 	The easiest part of the mission was checking the water type and condition. 	The most difficult part was trying to find the cause of the pollution and illness. 	I think it can be improved if we had a bigger class to have a first and second officer to limit the captain from running around everywhere.	9	9	8	It increased because when I would decrypt something and find the actual meaning I would tell this person and he/she would get back to me as soon as possible with answers. 	When the infinity knights headquarters would write something that was not understandable I would have to decrypt it. 	When all of the team was given a job in order to test the condition of the water. 	A great infinity knight would be trustworthy, good at communicating, and knowledgeable about situations. 	3	Communications	Yes	No	It was not very interesting as well as it didn‚Äôt let me voice my opinion to anyone. 	Captain because I have done that job the past two years and I liked it because I got to be in charge.  	They would have to have patience, good communication skills, and alert. 	Yes	I would try to get back to the people who wrote to me. 	Yes	Everyone was performing a task that was vital to the mission and the team. 									It showed how factory‚Äôs cause pollution in the environment around them and how it can effect a population. 	That pollution can impact a society‚Äôs food source in a large amount. 
2018/03/16 5:42:51 PM AST	421478	8th	Contaminant	i liked having teamwork really involved in the mission.	the easiest part was the beginning when all we had to do is swim.	the most difficult part was trying to get all the fish and complete the mission with only a small amount of oxygen left	i feel that the biologist should‚Äôve had more things to do	8	5	9	the captain did a pretty good job at getting the mission done and telling everyone what they needed to do.	me as a biologist didn‚Äôt have any part in the mission so i didn‚Äôt have to use problem solving skills.	i didnt get creative during the mission because i didn‚Äôt have a part in it	hard working, attentive, fast	5	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	No									Yes	as the biologist I did not have to do anything thing at all, the mission didn‚Äôt include my help.	i was interested in security guard because i‚Äôm good with keeping people safe and protected	attentitive and fast	No	i didn‚Äôt need to do anything 	No	the biologist didn‚Äôt do anything 	we are learning about how garbage is causing global warming and there was toxic waste and garbage in the river	teamwork is necessary for a good turnout in the end
2018/03/16 5:47:02 PM AST	1502917	8th	Contaminant	Finding the fish	Finding the fish	Our pilot couldn‚Äôt swim very well	Make the fish harder to find	10	9	10	When our leader told us to give each other the numbers and it decreased when the engineer didn‚Äôt help us quickly	When getting away from the group who owned the river	when catching the fish and running away	Compassion, commitment, and hardworking 	4	Security Chief	Yes	No	It did not suit me very well.

2018/03/17 8:37:27 AM AST	421496	8th	Contaminant	I most like the story line of the mission.	The easiest part was in the beginning.	The most difficult part was capturing the fish and getting away from the patrol shops.	I think the engineer station, because the engineer are responsible for almost everything. When one thing goes down the have to fix it, but they walk very slow so it is hard to keep the system up and running.	7	7	7	The biologist let the kimera go at the beginning and did not bring it back.

2018/03/17 10:17:43 AM AST	1500666	8th	Contaminant	Seeing how well some people did their job.	My job and the beginning of the mission 	Switching jobs, dealing with a new captain who was not that good, and dealing with a whole new crew and doing a job I did not want because we had to combine classes. 	Not combine mission groups after training. 	6	2	2	When we started yelling at each other because we were being attacked 	Looking for a person who entered the ship and tried to rob us and solved it. 	When we were being attacked and no one could help me 	Great leader ship, help others, give 100 percent effort.	2	Doctor	No									Yes	Because I had it at 1st and I was really good at it everyone accepted my medical requests and I was good with the Medication and I was also good at the surgery (s) but then I got put in with security. I will never be able to be the doctor now because it was our last mission.	Biologist because it seems hard and I love a good challenge 	Quick thinking, problem solving, staying calm 	No	In the mission my job was really easy and if I needed help I was the last person they would help and that made me feel like my job was not important.	No	Mine did not it was just dealing with Mini missions witch was not hard and the video person because they not really do anything 	We learned how pollution can hurt our planet and how the new company is hurting the water and fish/ their food. Also how pollution can effect us like it did to the children in the mission.	We need to take care of our planet unless we want to end-up like these people.
2018/03/17 10:19:48 AM AST	1504256	8th	Contaminant	My job	Trying to find the fish	Doing the water scans	The story line	9	9	8	The captain helping my solve a problem with the engines. The 2nd commander helping me with the codes for water scans.	"When all of the engines were down and I had fix all of it

And we also learned about how we should stop littering. 	Fish can survive under waterfalls.
2018/03/17 11:52:05 AM AST	701068	8th	Contaminant	Learning about how pollution can cause a chain effect to killing the fish and then the sandfly population increasing because of little trout and predators there were	All of the water scans while the ship is stopped in the water	The ambush of the Vikasa corp. ships attacking us, causing a little bit of panic as our engineers and tactical are trying their best.	How un-detailed all of the water was. We couldn't see the flies, or the pollutants in the water unless we needed to. (School of fish we had to save)	10	9	10	Getting the water scans sone very quickly (Special procedure) and everyone holding their fire when I said to.	Where the oxygen was coming from where the fish were.	Using the shields to get the fish to follow us as we go on.	Brave, intelligent, creative.	5	Captain	Yes	Yes	Captain can be a very broad job when it comes to leading. The learning cap for all this role has to do seems very high.	Engineer. Making and innovating things for the good of a team, or the world seems like a very hard, yet very rewarding job. I plan to be a computer engineer/Programmer when I am older.	Hardworking, persistent, creative.	Yes	If the crew failed, most of the failure could be on your part. You lead the crew on what to do.	Yes	Every job, more or less, had at least 1 special operation that they had to preform, most jobs have much more than 1 operation, though. (Especially with special procedures)									How pollution can harm us. Also how a dying out population of some animal can drastically increase the population of another, more harmful animal/insect.	How chain reactions can easily occur from a corrupt company. Pollution leaks, fish die, dangerous insect population soars.

2018/03/18 3:26:59 PM AST	421465	8th	Contaminant	I liked that the mission required a stealth approach	every part, I was unable to fulfill my role due to lack of opportunity	none, I had no jobs or assignments to perform as tactical due to lack of enemies 	more instruction, higher production value, or getting literally any other synthesizer for the computer because that was painful	1	1	1	Navigator was unable to learn their station functions, the captain was completely lost	none, I had no opportunity to perform my assigned duty, nor authority to assist the rest of the crew	I was unable to provide input due to my station, no such event ever reached me	willingness to follow instructions, good communication ability, and basic reasoning capabillity	1	Pilot	No									Yes	instead of participating in the mission like I could have, I sat and watched from the tactical seat with no enemies to interact with	I was interested in pilot due to its integral status to the mission	basic math, and experience	No	I had no pressure or deadlines due to lack of enemies	No	due to the poor instruction of the navigator almost none of the active positions were able to perform their jobs	the mission tied in in almost no way at all to our current topic of study	I have learned nothing from this experience other than how frustrating it is to work with colleagues that do not know how to perform their tasks
2018/03/18 4:50:59 PM AST	421439	8th	Contaminant	i liked working with the people around me the best 	the easiest part was getting the ship around the water	the most difficult part was trying to get away from the people that were attacking us 	making it harder to find the fish should be improved 	10	8	7	security officer	trying to get away from the people that were attacking us 	when people were attacking us 	good at communicating, good at working with others, good at what their job is  	4	Navigator	Yes	Yes	yes because it was fun working with the pilot and the captain 	pilot because i would like to drive the ship 	good at working with others	No	no because there was no reason to be pressured 	Yes	yes because everyone had to work together to be able to succeed at the mission 									water pollution, fish 	working together will help you in the long run

2018/03/18 7:57:20 PM AST	701075	8th	Contaminant	I think it was very interesting when we got to go through the river because in other missions we really did not do anything in the water.	The easiest part of the mission was when I had to steer through the water just to get us upstream.	The hardest part was when the robots were fighting us and we had to keep the fish with us so I could not just speed away from the gunfire.	I think we could improved on how we communicate throughout the mission.	8	8	10	My trust increased because I feel the people around me could communicate with me easily. My trust decreased when some people were not completing their jobs correctly.	I had to use problem solving skills when I had to avoid the robots firing at me.	I had to be creative when the fish were following because if I steered out of there range I would have to keep waiting for them,so I had steered left to right so they could keep up.	Intelligent,Nice,Hard-Working	5	Pilot	Yes	Yes	I feel being a pilot would be a very fun job to do.	Captain because I want to know what‚Äôd it be like in a certain to actually lead other people to success 	Very Hard-Working and maybe sometimes Strict if their companions don‚Äôt follow rules	No	I felt that I did what was needed with no pressure.	Yes	Having one job less important than others could affect how well you complete the mission.									It shows what pollution is doing to our water. Also it shows how polluted water or air could affect an animal or person environment.	That we should keep our environments clean because it can heavily affect an entire population of anything.
2018/03/18 8:03:13 PM AST	701087	8th	Contaminant	What I liked the most about my mission was that I got to play a part and see what it‚Äôs like to take role of a particular job. I like that we all worked together and tried our best.	The easiest part of the mission was getting in the river.	The most difficult part was telling the computer what to do because it was not always the easiest. Another challenge was definitely finding the fish that took a long time.	Who gets what jobs.	5	5	4	The navigator and hacker had no idea what they were doing along with many others. This definitely had a bug impact on how the mission went.	When we were looking for data we all had to work together to find out who had what we were looking for.	in general when we did not know what to do or how to move.	Leadership, knowledge, compassion 	4	Doctor	No									No	No matter what job I was to receive I planned to work as hard as I could to reach my goals.	Captain, because I like helping people when they need it and having a little say in what goes on within the ship.	Patience, knowledge, leadership 	Yes	Because every couple minutes we were told how much time we had left and it was chaos.	Yes	We need as much help as possible.	We have been learning about pollution and how to make our society better.	I learned that not everything is as simple as it may seem.
2018/03/18 11:43:52 PM AST	701146	8th	Contaminant	I liked when we had to fight the enemy ships.	Taking the water samples, because the computer could do it for us.	"It was hard to navigate through the river,
we got lost multiple times."	There should be different routes to take through the river.	8	6	8	I had to communicate with the engineers so I could get more ammunition.	We had to stay safe from the enemies while our engine wasn‚Äôt working	We had to use the map and reflect on our water samples to figure out exactly where we were.	Determination, Perserverance, Honor.	4	Pilot	No									No	I applied for two jobs that I was comfortable doing in case I didn‚Äôt get my first choice	Engineer because I would have liked to make the ammunition and keep the engine/transmission running	You would have had to have good and, and could preserve your ammo and resources 	Yes	The enemies could have destroyed our ship if I didn‚Äôt do my job	Yes	Some people‚Äôs jobs depended on others for the mission to be completed.	We have been learning the effect of pollution in the environment. Also, we had to work as a team in some of our projects.	Working as a team is very important when trying to complete a mission. Also, their should be lots of communication within your team
2018/03/19 12:14:02 AM AST	421518	8th	Contaminant	I liked the position i was asked to fill.	Sitting in my chair and yelling at people to scan their hands.	Having everyone die at the last moment of the mission was really stressful!!	I think that you would make the one high pitched voice a little less high because it is a little annoying, but other than that i think it is extremely beneficial to students!	9	9	6	the person who‚Äôs position i don‚Äôt remember would scan their hand so i had to stop everything and do an emergency surgery.	When we as a team couldn‚Äôt figure out how to do a water scan!	when the 2nd officer was out i had to run back and forth to scan it‚Äôs hand.	They would have honor, compassion, and strength! which is our school motto!	5	Doctor	Yes	Yes	I would like to be a nurse!	I really didn‚Äôt like any others! This is because i am not into the whole job thing!	"A good amount of positivity because when people are dying you have to
keep a positive attitude for the family members who are grieving."	Yes	People were dying on me! That is the ultimate deadline!	Yes	We have to be a tam as a whole!									Dealing with ecosystems and how sensitive they are and pollution and how it‚Äôs effecting the earth.	"Don‚Äôt go into government water illegally they will get mad and yell at you! Also to not
pollinate the earth!"
2018/03/19 8:42:55 AM AST	701128	8th	Contaminant	My job	Filling out our job applications.	Finding out where the fish were.	Probably trying to avoid the robots as much as possible.	7	8	6	When we had to find out our codes from other stations.	Figuring out why and what was causing a breach in the security.	When the robots had breached the security we all had to figure out how we could help to try and save the mission.	Communication Skills, Kindness, Quick thinking	4	Security Guard	Yes	No	I feel that since I have already done it, I should experience different jobs.	Biologist. It had seemed like a fun job, and also a bit challenging.	Intelligence	Yes	It is always important to meet deadlines, whether it be for a job or for a project.	Yes	The jobs wouldn‚Äôt have been there if they hadn‚Äôt served a purpose to the mission.									How contamination is bad and can have horrible outcomes.	That everyone can make a difference in the ecosystem.

Determination bravery and strength	5	Security Chief	Yes	No	Because I just wanted to try new things and to me it wasn't as I thought	Captain is fun because you can help many others and participate in a positive way	Determination compassion and loyalty 	No	My job was very easy and I didn't feel under pressure at all	Yes	Because as one we took on the task and completed it with real teamwork 									Some of the things like pollution, we have been learning a lot about pollution and how it effects an environment 	I never knew that fish would completely migrate to a whole new area, I would have thought that they would stay and die.

2018/03/19 9:41:52 AM AST	421407	8th	Contaminant	The thing I liked most about the mission was that it was very interesting and fun to do. As second in command, I had more jobs to do than the last time I had that position, and the mystery was fun to try and figure out.	The easiest part of the mission was the beginning when we were testing the water.	The most difficult part of the mission was when we were being attacked.	To improve this mission I think that it should be easier when we get closer to the factory because it was very hard to fight off all of our attackers because there were too many at once.	8	8	9	When I was second in command and I had to give the crew orders to test the water, we all worked together quickly to complete it.	I had to use problem solving to help some people at their stations since they did not know what to do at first.	I had to be creative calling out orders because I didnt want to call out orders over the first in command, so I walked around to give out orders.	Three personaloty traits a great knight would have are problem solving abilities, good communication, and a hardworking attitude to get the job done. 	5	Engineers	Yes	No	I feel like I could never do the jobs I was given in a real life situation. 	I was interested in the photographer role because I love taking pictures.	I think a person acting in this particular job/role in the real world would need to know the different effects that the camera can do to make the picture look good and so people are able to see it in the dark simulator room.	Yes	I did because the crew relied on me for both of my jobs and if I didnt do it right, the crew would have had a better chance at failing.	Yes	Everyone had a vital role because there were many different parts that needed to be completed and each person had a different role to complete our task that was all important in their own ways.									We have been learning about global warming and pollution. It ties in with our mission because we found that the river was polluted by toxins.	Something new I have learned is how important it is to be able to lead. If someone can not help their crew work together, the mission would be failed before we even found the toxins because we had to work together to test the water. The commanders had to tell their crew what to do and it was important for that crew to listen.

2018/03/19 9:50:46 AM AST	903521	8th	Contaminant	I liked everything about the mission, I don't have a specific thing I liked about it.	Hacking the enemy ships attempting to hack us.	Starting to go full speed in the lake	I think we could use more help on the mission becuase we didn't know we have to tell the computer to check water levels until the teacher told us after awhile. 	8	6	4	engineer 	Entering in the code 	How to hack the enemy ships	Respect, well listening and caring about what they are doing 	3	Biologist	No									Yes	If we do not know what we're doing it's better to get something we know how to do 	biologist , I like biology 	knowing chemistry 	Yes	I felt a little pressured as time went on, I d8dnt wanna let my team down 	Yes	"If we didn't have any jobs, what would we have done?

Tacticle because it would be a fun and challenging job	Good aim	Yes	Yes because I need to get the fish back down the river but other ships were shooting at us and it was a disaster	Yes	Yes because we need everyone's help to complete the mission									We are learning about how humans are contaminating the air.

2018/03/19 10:55:35 AM AST	701091	8th	Contaminant	i liked that we all worked together, and we all had fun.	the easiest part of the mission was working together as a team.	The most difficult part of the mission was everyone doing there jobs correctly, and for me was keeping everything together as the engineer	I can improve keeping all of the systems functioning properly, because as the engineer everything was dieing and going empty.	10	8	10	I had trust in my infinity knights because i‚Äôve been with everyone and worked with everyone, but we had a good captain during our mission which controlled us and she helped us.	we had to use problem solving, when we had to scan the water because everyone had to do different tasks and work with each other.	we had to be creative when we had to figure out the different things, and we had to use all of our stations to come up with all of the different tasks.	social,intelligence, and hardworker	4	First Office	No									No	no because i feel the people know what i will work best with, and whatever they believe i am best for, i will do it.	i was interested in engineer because from previous missions it was really interesting	they would need to be hard working, and social, because without being social you won‚Äôt be able to help other people and yourself. you need to be hardworking because if you don‚Äôt work hard ou won‚Äôt succeed	Yes	yes because if i didn‚Äôt complete all of the expectations i would fail myself and the team.	Yes	yes, everyone had different jobs that they needed to do, and you needed to use each job to do the water testing and other tasks.	This mission tied into what we are learning in class because we are learning about pollution and did a lab about pollution and in our mission we were in a polluted water	something new and that i learned is that communicating with others is a really important part of the mission, and life.

2018/03/19 10:56:18 AM AST	421483	8th	Contaminant	I like how we had to work together to solve the problems on the mission	The easiest part of the mission was going to the place we needed to be.	The most difficult part of the mission was figuring out what was wrong and trying to help get rid of it.	Maybe we could have communicated more.	6	7	7	What decreases my trust was when something was wrong people would yell at each other, putting more stress and panic on people. 	My job as security guard one was to solve problems so whenever there was a problem I would solve it accordingly.	In some certain things I could not come up with a exact plan to solve something so I‚Äôm that situation I had to think of something fast.	Creative, bold, and willing to do things for your team.	4	Videographer	No									No	No because I still did the job I needed to do efficiently.	I was also interested in security chief because I knew how to do it.	Problem solving skills.	No	I felt like I knew what I was doing. 	Yes	Every job needs to be dealt me in order for other people to do theirs	We are learning about pollution and the mission was about pollution. This mission also showed how we effect the ecosystem: 	We should not put waste or harmful things into our ecosystem.

2018/03/19 11:01:04 AM AST	421442	8th	Contaminant	I liked the storyline of the mission the most because it was interesting to learn about and figure out. 	The easiest part of the mission was when we were doing the scans in for the water because we all worked together easily to give each other the information we needed. 	The most difficult part of the mission was trying to find our destination and trying to fight the people from the corporation. 	I think the direction could be improved because either we weren‚Äôt listening clearly or we were all just very confused, and a lot of groups were too. 	7	7	6	When we all were communicating for the water scans, it was easy for us to give each other the information and we all trusted each other. 	We had to use problem solving when figuring out where the ship needed to go. 	We had to be creative when fighting against the corporation and work together to win. 	Compatibly, knowledge, and intuition 	4	Navigator	No									No	With communications, I think I still did a fair job. 	First officer because I like to survey and work with others than solving things by my self. 	Determination, and loudness i guess	Yes	We were trying so hard to get the fish but it just wasn‚Äôt working and we didn‚Äôt have time 	Yes	We all worked together to get the job done 	This tied into our class because we were learning about pollution and global warming and how to fix it. 	It is very crucial for us to not cause pollution 
2018/03/19 12:21:49 PM AST	1502096	8th	Contaminant	I liked how we went underwater for the majority of the mission 	The easiest part of the mission was the create the caimara for the biologist position	The most difficult part was most likely fighting the factory‚Äôs robots	I think you can improve the mission by putting more challenges earlier on in the mission instead of just the robots in the end of it. 	9	7	1	One example of how we increased the trust in between my fellow infinity knights and I was how the first officers and security officer 2 helped one another when they had the preform the water scan and helped me with my part in it 	When I had to fight the robots, I had to figure out there best way to defeat them. 	I had to be creative when creating the caimara for the biologist position and figuring out what is the best qualities to include in it 	A great infinity kj night should be brave, kind, and intelligent 	4	Engineers	No									No	Even though I didn‚Äôt get the job I wanted, i still worked my hardest on the job I was assigned 	I was also interested in the communications position because decoding the messages received seemed fun and interesting 	I feel someone in the communications position would need to have good verbal skills with others to help share the messages they receive 	No	When I am given a deadline, I would actually work more efficiently to do a good job to meet the deadline 	No	Some jobs contributed more than others. For example, the tactical position would be more useful when fighting the robots and supporting the mission rather than the hacker who didn‚Äôt need to do much, for no one really tried to hack the ship during the mission 	One example is how the pollution we create can harm the wild life around use. Another example is how the pollution we create can also indirectly harm us.  For example, how the fish were harmed but the pollution, making it hard for the people to fish because all of the fish were either non edible or they all have died. 	I learned how the pollution we create has a major negative impact not only on the wildlife and atmosphere but, also on us and our daily needs 
2018/03/19 12:22:07 PM AST	1502998	8th	Contaminant	What I liked most about the mission is the Fun we all had working together and trying to figure out and solve each problem that came our way as a team.	The easiest part of the mission for me was making sure that everyone was in good health since I was the doctor,  but the easiest part was finding the fish.	Most difficult part of the mission was doing all of the water scans and keeping up with updates to the governor also staying away from the vikasa corporation.	We could have improved our listening skills during the mission more.	6	3	9	The Captain  and the pilot helped build my trust a lot through out the mission.	I had to problem solve any time that someone was Injured or sick on board.	When I was finding medications for the crew when they were hurt or sick i had to be quite creative.	They need to be brave and full of courage	4	Doctor	Yes	Yes	No because I am not interested in going into a medical field.	I was interested in the biologist because it just fascinated me.	They would need to be brave and have great courage.	No	No because there is not much pressure if you believe in yourself and that you can do it.	Yes	If we did not have everyone working together as a team we would have failed the mission. 									it tied into our learning of pollution and how it is effected wildlife and humans.	I learned about the effects of contaminated water.

2018/03/19 12:38:40 PM AST	421405	8th	Contaminant	I liked that everyone worked together to overcome the mission.	The easiest part of the mission was listening to others if something went wrong.	The most difficult part of the mission was fighting the disease.	I think that the disease could be defeated quicker if we did this mission again.	7	8	10	Deck chief and Engineer.	When I had to do what my job was asking me to do.	I had to be creative when working quickly but doing my job correctly.	Kind, helpful, and positive.	5	Doctor	Yes	Yes	I like to learn about this type of educational field.	I was interested in engineer too because it involves repairing things.	They would need to be skillful.	Yes	I had to work quickly.	Yes	Every job effected the mission because when one person messed up the whole class would have to work together to fix it.									It taught me how quickly a disease can spread due to House we treat an environment.	I‚Äôve learned that people must work together to achieve a goal.

The end was the hardest part because we were being attacked. 	Nothing, it was super fun. 	7	5	6	The engineer repaired my station. The pilot sometimes acted silly and didn‚Äôt do what he was supposed to. 	I had to do mini-missions in my station to train my guards and other people. 	I had to put the alert things in the right places, so I had to think of good spots. 	Socialable, friendly, intelligent. 	5	Security Chief	Yes	No	Out of the mission, I‚Äôm not interested in having it as a real job. 	I was interested in the doctor role. I like taking care of people. 	They would have to be careful and alert. 	No	My job wasn‚Äôt extremely hard. 	Yes	When everyone works together, the job gets done faster. 									Pollution (in the water) and power plants. 	Pollution can affect living things directly and indirectly. 
2018/03/19 12:39:20 PM AST	1501463	8th	Contaminant	I liked the mission we had and the tasks we had to perform while on the mission.	The easiest part of the mission was whenever we didn‚Äôt have the checklists.	The most difficult part was definitely when we were under attack and everything started failing.	We should have been better with time management.	8	9	9	The communications station was talking loudly while the captain was trying to talk with the computer.	Whenever we had the checklists with everyone‚Äôs different assignments.	We had to figure out a way to get the water scans so we asked the computer.	Trustworthy, bravery, and intelligence	5	Doctor	No									No	No, because it didn‚Äôt matter which job I had, because each one was important.	Captain because they had a big responsibility.	Intelligence, multitasking, and problem solving skills	Yes	Yes because they were depending on me to help everyone with their assignments.	Yes	Yes, because everyone had a specific job to do.	We are currently learning about pollution. And global warming as well.	Meeting deadlines is both stressful and important.
2018/03/19 12:41:54 PM AST	421429	8th	Contaminant	The water scans	The take off	Escaping the company 	Our use of energy and the fighting with the monsters	8	6	7	We didn‚Äôt know how to Usenet the communications and we also didn‚Äôt know what the data collections did	We needed to work together to do the water scans 	With the fighteing and when we didn‚Äôt have any energy 	Intelligence organization and Good team work skills	4	Doctor	No									No	I was fine with it what I got 	The pilot because it seemed fun	Good sense of direction 	Yes	I did good when we had to do water scans 	Yes	We needed to work together	Pullution and fish 	How to stop pullution 
2018/03/19 12:41:59 PM AST	421477	8th	Contaminant	I liked helping out the team and everyone working together the best. It was really fun!	Doing my job was the easiest because I had previous practice.	The most difficult was keeping up with all the damages of the ship and trying to fix them all at once. It was sort of overwhelming.	I think our cooperation skills and listening skills could have been improved due to some people not knowing what to do from lack of paying attention.	8	7	9	One thing that helped increase trust between us was fighting together and communicating very much allowing us to become one to face the battle.	We had to use problem solving skills when trying to scan the water and find out what was polluting it.	When our ship went down and we couldn‚Äôt reach the computer we had to come up with a solution.	Hard working, working together, and friendliness 	5	Captain	No									No	Although I didn‚Äôt get what I wanted still getting to do something was exciting	Deck chief seemed really interesting  to me since I‚Äôve had it before and it was very fun.	They would need coordination and mechanic skills.	Yes	I believed that if I messed up the blame would fall on me so pressure was then applied	Yes	Yes because everyone was trying their best and that‚Äôs all that matters 	It tied to what we‚Äôve been learning about non renewable recourses. Also how germs and fungi we had previously learned about.	I learned a lot of things can cause pollution and we need to be careful with our recourses
2018/03/19 12:46:16 PM AST	421430	8th	Contaminant	My favorite part of the mission was preforming surprise medical operations on people.	The easiest part of the mission was making sure the temperature of our ship was safe.	The most difficult part of the mission was getting everyone to work together.	I think my group can improve on their teamwork and leadership skills.	10	1	5	In my mission, everyone was yelling at eachother and telling them they were doing everything wrong(communications). Also, the captain didn‚Äôt understand anything he was doing so it was hard for me to trust them.	I had to use problem  solving when I had to preform medical operations.	When the first officer wouldn‚Äôt allow the medical scan to happen, I did it for her.	A good infinity knight should show leadership, be kind, and always have respect for everyone else on the mission	1	Doctor	Yes	Yes	I would like to go into the medical field because I live helping people out.	I also seemed interested in the Captain because I believe I could be a good leader.	I think a good captain would need to be responsible and have good leadership.	Yes	I don‚Äôt want anyone to be mad at me for letting them die, so I feel very pressured.	Yes	Everyone plays a very important role in the mission.									Im science, we are learning about pollution and our mission was about contaminated water.	I have learned hat not everyone can be good leaders.
2018/03/19 12:58:00 PM AST	1500724	8th	Contaminant	Having my job	Taking pictures	Getting the water scans	More jobs	10	10	10	Gibe videographer a station	Water scans	When we were under attack	Optimistic, good attitude, team work	4	Doctor	No									No	Not all the jobs are as popular as others	Hacker, it feels like a video game	Leadership 	Yes	It feels rushed 	Yes	Because we are all a special paet of the mission 	Pollution, the 6th extinction	How important teamwork is.
2018/03/19 1:36:55 PM AST	701070	8th	Contaminant	Solving the challenges that we were asked to complete	The easiest part was finding the fish	The hardest part was finding out why the people were getting sick	We could‚Äôve had better communication and found out why everyone is getting sick	7	6	5	Everyone communicating and completing their tasks	We had to find the PH levels of the water and we found it out	When we had to keep the fish all together	Respectful, cooperative, and teamwork 	4	First Office	Yes	Yes	Because it seem like an interesting job and it‚Äôs challenging which I like	I was interested in being the hacker because I would like to challenge myself	To be successful in this job they would have to be able to communicate, problem solve, and and be creative.	No	I felt like my job was pretty straight forward I just needed to follow my instructions 	Yes	Because to complete anything with multiple roles you need to work as a team. So if one job didn‚Äôt do it‚Äôs job than the whole team fails as a group									The mission ties right in with what we are learning in science. Because we are learning about pollution and we have to keep the fish free from pollution. Also we have to figure out why everyone is getting sick. That ties in because if there is more pollution that cause global warming and that causes temperatures to rise which diseases can survive longer and reproduce.	That no matter what you need to complete you always need to work as a team.
2018/03/19 2:02:23 PM AST	1502357	8th	Contaminant	The experience	Using the fusion chamber as engineer	Using the sequencer as engineer	Some of the controls and directions	8	7	8	When the pilot flew into enemy ships	When we could not find out what was causing the pollution	Capturing the fish using our shield	Kindness, understanding, helpful	5	Engineers	Yes	No	I feel that real engineering is much different from what had happened in the simulator	Communications, I'm good with words and talking to people	Understanding, helpfulness, kindness, friendly	Yes	Because of how slow the engineers moved from station to station, there was no time to repair everything	Yes	Because we were a team, and the job would not be there if it weren't useful									It ties into pollution on how rivers were polluted	That as a team, everybody achieves more

2018/03/19 2:06:02 PM AST	421406	8th	Contaminant	The situations we did. The testing of the water.	Me just pilotij slowly through the river.	When we got swarmed by the ships in the water.	The amount of time we get for it.	10	4	8	The engineers were taking a pretty long time to fix the ship. There was also only me communicating with them. The other positions were fine.	When we didn‚Äôt know how to test the water.	When the fish couldn‚Äôt go in the ship.	Communication, intelligence, and strength.	5	Pilot	Yes	Yes	Yes, I believe it was a very cool experience. You were able to control everything it almost felt like.	Navigation, it seemed cool how you could look at a radar and see everything that is or was around you.	Good eyesight, good navigating skills.	Yes	Because if i mess up, the mission would have failed.	Yes	Because every job help every little part of the ship.									The pollution of the lakes and the disease being spread.	The ability to calm down in a bad situation.
2018/03/19 2:06:26 PM AST	701131	8th	Contaminant	I liked when we found the fish.	The easiest part was just going up the stream	The most difficult part was when we were attaked	I think that the graphics could be improved	3	5	8	When we found the fish it increased the trust between everyone else‚Äôs and I.	When we were doing water scans and we had to work together	I didn‚Äôt have to be creative with coming up with a solution	#NAME?	4	Doctor	Yes	Yes	Because metical things interest me	Hacker seemed interested to me because I am interested in computers	#NAME?	No	Because I didn‚Äôt have to do much during most of the mission	Yes	Because everyone had to do something 									It involved a olution and hi  it effects living things around it	I have learned teamwork
2018/03/19 2:06:36 PM AST	701059	8th	Contaminant	I like that we worked together and found the fish and the cause of the fish staying	The easiest part was when we had to scan the water and try to figure out the temperature and what was in the water	The most difficult part was when we had to fight off the enemy ships in the water 	We could have had more people for the stations that were open 	8	7	9	Captain communications	We had to use the skills when we found the fish and had to transport them back to the city‚Äôs river system	We had to be creative when we had to take the fish back to the city	You have to work well with others, think quickly about problems, and have to do you job correctly 	2	Engineers	No									No	I was just glad to do my last mission as an 8th grader	I was interested in pilot because you control the ship and it is a fun position	You need to be a quick thinker and have to work well with other people	No	I was calm and when I was told what to do i did it	Yes	Everyone is important and everyone had to have a job or solve a problem	It tied in by someone having out polution in the water	Work well with others and do your job
2018/03/19 2:07:09 PM AST	421506	8th	Contaminant	That we got to control the mission 	Making the crazy animal 	Finding the fish and taking them back and talking to people 	That we all stayed calm and worked better 	7	8	10	That we all worked together and had fun while doing it 	We didn‚Äôt know how to get the fish 	Fighure out what was damaging the water	Brave nice and compatable 	3	Captain	No									Yes	Because I wanted to be captain 	Pilot cause my dads one 	Brave and compatable 	No	I don‚Äôt worry about a lot of atuff	Yes	Everybody needs to work together 	That we‚Äôre talking about diseases and stuff and t	That we need to work as a team

Teamwork can make you successful 
2018/03/19 2:10:29 PM AST	421396	8th	Contaminant	I liked how everyone worked together to try and complete the mission.	The easiest part was my job.	The most difficult part was everyone communicating and getting the word around but some people failed to do so.	Everyone communicate more and we wouldn‚Äôt stay stopped and maybe we could get farther.	10	6	7	The increase of my trust was communications because they mostly got everything out	We stayed in one place for awhile and that didn‚Äôt help us conplete	I really didn‚Äôt because I had to worry about the ship more than other people.	Communicative, Helpful, Challenging	4	Engineers	Yes	Yes	It was a fun job	Pilot because it was a main job and it seems fun.	Pay Attention!!	No	We did our own thing as engineers	Yes	Everyone had a part in the mission									Pollution and Diseases	Working together as a team and getting things done

2018/03/19 3:03:56 PM AST	701076	8th	Contaminant	How everyone was helping each other when needed.	Flying the ship to the planet and diving into the water.	Trying to escape whenever the patrol ships are there and they block the way while your trying to escape.	If there was a bit more people so we get all of the help when needed.	7	6	6	When the navigator helped me when I was lost on where the arrows were pointing at.	Finding the way out when the navigator was busy helping others.	The part when the patrol ships were blocking the way.	Skills, Intelligence, and Compassion.	4	Pilot	Yes	Yes	Yes, because it seems interesting and I think I can handle doing it again.	Doctor, because I want to see how the doctor helps other heal.	Just helping others when needed.	Yes	Yes, because people would scream at you if you don‚Äôt do your job correctly. 	Yes	Yes, because almost every job is different and hard to get used to.									Communicating with others and working as a team.	People will help if they see you struggling.

As the second officer got messages to tell others. 	We had to use problem solving skills when we had to get the water sample. 	We had to be creative when we had to problem solve to tell others what to type in there keypads. 	You need to be on task And communicate well with others you also need to be loud and speak up. 	3	Engineers	Yes	Yes	It seems very interesting 	I thought the security guide was interesting becaoyse if whatvyou would do 	You would need some math or ela skills 	No	My job is not that hard to follow	Yes	Everybody needs to contribute and everybody has a part to the mission. 									It has to do with pollution and solving problems 	Something new is the way that an evil environment  can change over one thing 
2018/03/19 3:07:33 PM AST	701177	8th	Contaminant	Making the fish follow us that was cool	Scaning the water	The end when we fought the ships	Having a more air	10	10	5	Helping fight the drones	Scaning the water	We did not know how to scan	Trust compassion stealth	5	Biologist	No									Yes	I was never a biologist	Hacker it looked cool	What to hack to help your team	Yes	I thought that i would mess up	Yes	They all help in different ways	We were learning about pollution	Do not let a company take your river
2018/03/19 3:18:27 PM AST	1500203	8th	Contaminant	I liked that everyone had a job to do each time we changed streams. Like aligning coordinates and testing the river quality. 	The easiest part of the mission was finding the fish. This was easy because we just had to follow the path to the fish. 	The hardest part was when we found the patrol fish because they all attacked and we lost all engine power so we had to quickly escape. 	If we had more people on our team, we could of done better in the mission. We did not have a first or second officer so it would‚Äôve been better if we had one. 	8	9	9	I could rely on the engineers to power up our engine and get us moving again and rely on the doctor for keeping us alive. 	When we scanned the water we had to figure out if it was fresh and healthy or not. 	We had to be creative because we had to figure out how to bring the fish back without being caught. 	The personality traits a great Infinfy Knight would have are bravery, intelligence, and seriousness. 	5	Communications	Yes	Yes	It seemed interesting and I didn‚Äôt get to activate and portals as the Navigator.  	Communications because it seemed fun figuring out the messages being sent to the ship. 	They would need to be a fast typer, be able to read decoded messages, and be able to know how to call the governor. 	Yes	The Navigator was hard to do because it kept increasing speed and it would not slow down and would only go faster. 	Yes	Each job had an important role for the mission to be completed like being able to go into stealth mode and activate shields. 									We learned about different fossil fuels and the smoke from the factory caused air pollution. The water had been polluted and so did some of the land but the water is a renewable recourse but the water needs to stay clean. 	Something new I learned in the mission is that the water being polluted is why the fish went missing but really just swam upstream. 
2018/03/19 3:20:40 PM AST	421488	8th	Contaminant	How we got to help the community 	Finding the fish 	Getting the fish to follow us 	it could have been easier to do	8	9	9	the captain helped everyone and other people also volunteered to help	trying to fight of the other ship 	when we had to do a really important job and needed to get it done 	"Kindness

2018/03/19 3:24:09 PM AST	421394	8th	Contaminant	How we had to work with each other and save the fish so we could see what the kasa is doing to the river.	Piloting the ship	Shooting the other ships	How the captian runs scans 	9	7	8	"that the physist kept yelling at me and he was not going his job

On how other populations effect earth	Work as a team.
2018/03/19 4:02:21 PM AST	1501045	8th	Contaminant	Repairing the systems was fun when there weren't so many that needed repair.	It was easier at the beginning, as we weren't really needing many repairs. The enemies did not know we were there at first.	When the enemies located us, there was a huge spike in difficulty. Our teammates were having trouble defeating the enemies, so they just kept firing at us and damaging our ship. Almost all of the systems went down, and it takes forever to fix them.	I believe the mission would be better overall if repairs didn't take as long. It was very hard to repair all of the systems before we were attacked again because it took way too long to repair each one.	7	7	8	There was one instance where we were being hacked and I figured that we were basically done, but the hacker was able to stop it with ease. Afterwards I was convinced the hacker could handle all future cyber attacks. 	When most of the systems were down, we had to fix the most important ones that would allow us to defeat the enemies. 	I worked with the team to choose which systems we should prioritize when repairing.	An Infinity Knight would never give up, be able to multitask, and be able to remain calm under pressure.	4	Engineers	Yes	No	I would not want to be a Engineer in reality because I am not as good with physical tasks and getting my hands dirty. I‚Äôm more interested in technology and such.	I was also interested in hacker because it involves the innards of computer technology.	They would need to be good at planning, teamwork, and coordination. Being fit and strong would help also. 	Yes	Everybody depended on the engineers for their systems to be operational. 	No	The videographer and researcher are really not necessary for the success of the mission									In science, we learned about pollution. In the mission, the water was polluted. We also learned of the effects of the pollution on the environment and ecosystems. In the mission, the people were sick and the fish were unhealthy.	I learned that pollution is a real danger that needs to be reduced or stopped altogether.
2018/03/19 4:07:41 PM AST	701135	8th	Contaminant	I liked how my team tried to help the fish and also the kids that got the disease from sand flies. 	When the pilot drives under water. ( I wasn‚Äôt the pilot )	Probally the communications telling us what to do and to progress through the mission.	To focus more on the mission and stop goofing around.	9	10	9	Communication is key.	By to keep things steady or rapid. (Ex. Stealth-85%, Visabilty-10%	By my 5 things if you want them to be high or low. 	Talkative, Kindness, Working Hard.	5	Physicist	Yes	No	I don‚Äôt want to be a physicist when I get older.	I wanted to be a Hacker instead of a physicist, because I‚Äôve been a Hacker twice during two missions. But I don‚Äôt want to be one when I get older. 	Pilot.	No	I didn‚Äôt need to help during the deadline as much as some people did in their positions.	Yes	I believe that every position is a big pet for everyone because we need to accomplish the mission so you need to help your team out. Can‚Äôt just leave hem behind.									Of how we learned about the pollution in the waters hurting habitats, animals, and also people.	Some kinds of gas or pollution can hurt or do something horribly bad for important things. 
2018/03/19 4:24:25 PM AST	701150	8th	Contaminant	I liked to be able to work with other people.	The easiest part was finding out why there was no fish.	The most difficult part of the mission was to find where the fish were and get the fish to follow us.	I think that there should be a more realistic storyline.	7	8	7	When we had to test the water everybody had to work together to enter the correct codes and this increased trust.	We had to use problem solving method to find out why there were no fish.	I had to be creative in coming up with a solution when we could not get the fish to follow us.	A great Infinity Knight would have to have cooperation, teamwork skills, and leadership.	3	Pilot	No									Yes	It affected me because I feel I was not able to work with my classmates as good at my position.	The hacker seemed to interest me because it seemed fun to help your teammates fight of enimies trying to hack you.	A person in this situation would need to have cooperation, teamwork skills, and leadership skills.	No	I did not feel pressure because this was not a high pressure situation.	No	Every job is not critical because I was physist two out of the three years we were in the simulator and I was not able to help my classmates with what I was able to do with my job.	One example is when we do a group lab, I will know how to cooperate better with my group. Another example is when our group needs to find out a problem, we can use teamwork skills to find out the problem.	I have learned how to cooperate with others while completing this mission.
2018/03/19 5:26:38 PM AST	929040	8th	Contaminant	Identifying the cause of the problem. And the altercations with the patrol vessels in the stream. Also scanning the river for harmful toxins.	Was identifying the toxins in the river. Also hacking in to the patrol vessels.	Trying to not blow our cover during the mission. So the patrol vessels could destroy us.	The way we operated the defense of our craft. when we were discovered by the patrol vessels. 	10	10	10	What increased my trust with my fellow Infinity Knights was we all were accomplishing a common goal and there was no room for lying or distrust between each other.	When we were being hacked by the patrol vessels. I successfully hacked two patrol vessels. And the rest were almost successful in hacking us.	When we were being attacked, by the patrol vessels I was creative by devising a plan to escape the wrath, or destroy the patrol vessels, we agreed to escape then destroy. So we escaped before we could be possibly killed.	Honor, Compassion, Strength.	5	Hacker	Yes	Yes	Why? Because I could be hired in the military to hack the computers of other hackers. Foreign or domestic.	Second Officer, because I could keep the ship's log and take over if the Captain and First Officer are put out of commission.	A professional in computers. Knows how to hack your enemy and where.	No	Why Not? Because I knew what I was doing and I had no reason to be worried.	Yes	Why? Because All the job's count, they all contribute to the mission and minus one and you would be in trouble.									It talks about respecting the environment and global warming.	Some large corporations really do cover up there doings if they harm the environment.
2018/03/19 7:25:20 PM AST	bh0421445	8th	Contaminant	What I liked most about the mission was my job.	The easiest part of the mission was the very beginning we were just calmly swimming in the river.	The most difficult part of the mission was when we found the fish and had to bring them back to were they belonged.	I think communication can be improved.	2	2	5	The communication person was having a really difficult time at doing their job and the captain upset the headquarters a lot.	We had to use problem solving skills when we were trying to get the fish back to we're they belonged.	When we got spotted in the river by the people who owned it.	Communication, risk taker, and good problem solving skills.	3	First Office	No									Yes	I wasn't prepared for my job.	The second officer because I feel like a good person to carry out tasks and rules.	Communication, teamwork, and good at listening 	Yes	I was in charge of the flooding and fires and everything like that so I felt really rushed when multiple things were happening at once and I had to fix them all.	Yes	If it wasn't needed it probably wouldn't have been made a job.	When we were talking about renewable and non renewable resources and when we had to the turbine lab.	Communication is key
2018/03/19 7:47:30 PM AST	1504368	8th	Contaminant	it was fun	getting things fix up	getting away from the enimies	nonthing	7	9	10	we work together	no officers	just helping out	yes it is	5	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	No									No	idk just not i was good at it	nonthing	team work	No	just not	Yes	it was successful	team work	hacking being officer 1
2018/03/19 7:53:10 PM AST	421460	8th	Contaminant	Doing Research 	Briefing 	Getting the fish to follow the ship 	The cooperation 	8	5	4	I gave a detailed report on the wild life in the area and, I kept my computer on when the rest turned off. 	The reports i gave. 	Looking up the symptoms for a disease. 	Compassion, Attentiveness, and Intellect 	4	Data Collections	No									No	I was not their to get the job application and, I figured if I did my job well i could possibly get a better job at a later date. 	Pilot as I have certification to fly an actual plane. 	A drive for knowledge. 	Yes	I always want to do the best I can in every situation. 	No	Some jobs such as my job, are that of a simple filler occupation. 	The pollutants used in the mission and,  their effect on the wild life. 	Energy can always effects on the world
2018/03/19 8:45:02 PM AST	1500282	8th	Contaminant	I loved my job as doctor it was exciting an innovative- I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt have tactical because this was a great job for my last mission.	The beginning and practice runs because I wasn‚Äôt rushed with emergency surgeries and fatal injuries.	Towards the end of the mission, I was overloaded with emergency surgeries and injured patients- which was extremely stressful because I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die.	The selection of people based on their argumentative essays could have been analyzed better because students from previous years received the same jobs.	7	8	6	The captain wasn‚Äôt always completing his tasks and crew members will telling him what to say and do.	Sometimes when I administered a pill, it would decrease blood pressure and raise the pulse- leaving me unable to bring the patient‚Äôs‚Äô symptoms to normal conditions.	I had to balance patients towards the end while I was getting many medical requests. To do this I performed the emergency surgeries first and then left the injured patients in mediocre condition while I tended to others.	Honor, respect, and perserverence are the three traits a participating student should have when working with a team.	4	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	No									Yes	If someone didn‚Äôt get the job they wanted, it could affect their additude and teamwork ethic throughout the entire mission.	Tactical because I‚Äôve been shooting since Elementary school.	Practice with target shooting and good aim.	Yes	I felt like I couldn‚Äôt let my fellow teammates down.	No	Data collections officer was only given one opportunity to perform a task, after that he sat there and waited for the mission to end.	We have been learning about contamination- the mission is called contaminant and focuses on the pollution of water.	Radiation levels are affecting the well being of fish and other plants and creatures in the water.
2018/03/19 9:00:22 PM AST	701156	8th	Contaminant	I enjoyed doing my position and the jobs the most during the mission.	The easiest part of the mission was finding the fish.	The most difficult part of the mission was completing all of our tasks. 	I believe that our group could of completing some tasks quicker.	8	8	7	Completing our tasks on time and correctly helped increase the trust between me and my peers.	I had to use problem solving skills while completing some tasks for my position.	I had to be creative while completing some puzzles and tasks that were part of my position.	Responsibility, maturity, and intelligence.	4	Engineers	Yes	Yes	My position was interesting and entertaining.	I was interested in the security guard because it seemed easy and entertaining.	A person would have to be responsible and mature to be successful as a security guard and engineer.	Yes	Some tasks I was faced with were challenging.	Yes	Every job contributed help to completing the mission by helping every position.									This mission is similar to what we are learning in class because it involves pollution which we are learning about in class. We are also learning about protecting our planet, which we were attempting to do during the mission.	I have learned that every job helps contribute to success and that requires responsibility and maturity.
2018/03/19 10:30:51 PM AST	421468	8th	Contaminant	Out of the many things I liked about the mission, my favorite thing I liked was when we got to catch the fish in the net in which they followed us.	The easiest part of the mission was probably when we caught the fish in the net because it took us the least amount of time compared to other challenges.	The most difficult part of the mission was when we had to scan the water. This was the hardest part because there were many things we had to do to get the scans. We did not know how to do many of those challenges.	I think our time can be improved on this mission because it took to long to complete one task.	6	7	4	I feel the captain did not do a good job communicating not only with our crew but with the computer. At one point in the mission the computer was waiting for an order that took the captain 20 minutes to order.	I had to use problem solving skills when I had to change the ship to fit the environment better. If we needed to go faster, I would change it to the light armored one.	I had to be creative because when we were running out of oxgen and needed to go faster, I switched it to a lighter and faster ship.	Three personality traits a great infinity knight would have is hardworking because if you do not hustle then you will not get done in time. Intelligent because if you can not think quick on the spot then you will most likely fail. Finally, athletic because you must be able to move fast not to fail.	3	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	Yes	No	I do not believe I want to go into any field that involves shooting.	I believe pilot looks interesting because you can drive like you are driving a car or in a video game.	This person has to be quick because if they are about to crash than they must turn quickly.	Yes	If I messed up then I would not only be letting my self down but my crew mates also.	Yes	Every job had a certain task that had to be completed. If those tasks were not completed then the mission would be failed									This mission has been tied to what we have been working on because we have been talking about pollution in which the lake was polluted. Also we have been talking about extinction, in which the fish have gone missing and we don't know where they are.	I have learned that team work and communication is key in this process because if we can not talk to each other and say what we need to get done then we will fail the mission.
2018/03/19 11:59:49 PM AST	791080	8th	Contaminant	What I like most about the mission was when we found the other fish	The easiest part was going up grime the water	Staying in water	What I think can improve the about the mission is teem work	7	3	5	I started not believe in my teem mate because no was really work as a group all we were doing  was yelling on top of each other	When I did not get something I asked my teem mate	Was when all are planned had run out	I think that some time working as a teem is good and others time it‚Äôs just a wasted time	2	Communications	No									No	Because I will learn house to is my new job and I really didn‚Äôt care what I got	I was really not interested in any other rolls because communication seemed like the easy one	In the game missions no one really cared that much because they no it‚Äôs just a game but in the really world they no it‚Äôs serious and they have to be for real and take it seriously 	No	I really did not feel pressured because no one was really up in my face yelling at me of telling me what to do	Yes	I reall Did not think it was critical	I really don‚Äôt think it will help me or my group because we did not  finished the Mission and we really don‚Äôt no what‚Äôs going on	That controlling the ship is not as easy as it look 
2018/03/20 12:10:13 AM AST	701080	8th	Contaminant	What I like most about the mission is when we found the fish	Was going up from the water	Staying down in the water	What I think can improve is teem work	6	4	6	I started losing trust in my team mate because no one was helping each other every one was ting over other	Was when I did not get something I had to ask my teem mate	Was when my first plane failed 	Something it can be helpful others time it‚Äôs just a waste of time	2	Communications	No									No	No because it really did not matter to be and I picked communication because last time I got that	I really did not seem interested in any other things	In the acting they really don‚Äôt care about anything but in the really world they will care	No	I say no because I really did not really pressure because no one was up in my face telling me what‚Äôs right and what wrong	Yes	I feel like every job was critical because we all had to be doing work 	I really don‚Äôt think this will help much with my science class because we did not  finish and we really don‚Äôt know what going on	I learn that controlling the ship is not as easy as it looks
2018/03/20 7:17:48 AM AST	701153	8th	Contaminant	Talking with others 	Scanning water	Working together 	People need to know more background information about there rule 	2	4	2	We were scanning the water and people were getting mad so they kept saying they were gonna take over 	I needed to get a code off of someone 	When we went the wrong way 	 Communication, strategy, strong 	3	Security Guard	Yes	No	If I do want to when I am older I will but I might not want to waist time on something I might not do 	The  pilot because it seemed fun 	 Communication and trust 	Yes	We all had to tasks and if we didn‚Äôt do them then we would have not made it 	Yes	If one person didn‚Äôt do there job then we would all failed 									We learned how people  pollute the water and in the mission we learned the same thing 	To work together with other people 
2018/03/20 7:29:59 AM AST	1505919	8th	Contaminant	Everyone helped each other.	I didn‚Äôt have to do that much.	When I have to do something but I don‚Äôt know how to do it.	Everyone knowing what to do.	9	10	10	My trust increased when the team was helping each other.	How much power I should give to there people.	When we were test the water.	Willing to get along with others,caring,and  brave.	5	Doctor	No									No	Because I still couldn‚Äôt know what to do.	Hacker because I was it the last time.	Determination 	Yes	Because they are counting on me.	Yes	Because every job is important,if one wasn‚Äôt their no thing will go right	We are learning about population and in the mission the water was polluted.	I learned that no matter what you are doing it‚Äôs important to help others.
2018/03/20 8:10:55 AM AST	1502213	8th	Contaminant	I liked the storyline of the mission the best.	The easiest part was finding the fish	The most difficult part of he mission was trying to get away from the enemy.	One thing I think could be improved was the overall communication about stations being down.	9	9	10	One thing that increased my trust was that everyone was honest about what was going on at their station.	I had to use problem solving when I had to fix security alerts.	I had to be creative when fixing security alerts by sending out instructions.	Three traits need would be good communication skills, attentiveness, and humbleness.	5	Deck Chief	No									No	No because I was still able to complete the mission.	Another role that seemed interesting was communications because it would let me work on communicating with my peers in the sense of passing along messages.	Skills needed would be alertness, and confidence.	Yes	Security alerts would fill the screen and be distracting.	Yes	Yes, each job made sure all the other stations were up and running.	The mission covered the effects of pollution, which is what we've been covering.	Something new I learned was teamwork.
2018/03/20 8:18:49 AM AST	421505	8th	Contaminant	"I liked when we found the fish and had them follow us the most.
"	The easiest part of the mission was swimming upstream.	The most difficult part of the mission was when we reached the factory and had to defeat the ships.	The voices could be improved to help us understand more.	8	8	8	Some people just say at their stations and did nothing.	When we had to scan the water we had to read off the codes to other people.	We had to turn around and get the fish so we had to figure out how to stay hidden.	The mush be confident, hardworking, and willing to work with others 	3	Security Chief	No									No	"I still did my job and what i was supposed to do because i didn‚Äôt have a choice.
"	I have been engineer for every mission.	They would have to be willing to help others.	Yes	Because i wanted to succeed.	Yes	Without everyone we wouldn‚Äôt be able to succeed.	We have been learning about pollution and global warming so the stuff the factory was putting in the water was pollution and when the color of the water was off so it was polluted.	I learned that many things can pollute water.

2018/03/20 8:32:48 AM AST	701102	8th	Contaminant	How we got to work as a team and solve a problem together.	The easiest part of the mission was the streams before we got to the factory.	The most difficult part was the final area when we passed the factory, we almost died.	Make the final ships a little easier to kill.	8	10	10	I trusted our captain to lead us,. I also trusted the pilot to take ya the right way and aim at targets to shoot.	When we had to do the water scan, it gave us information to give to the government so they could solve their problem.	We had to ask the computer to do our water scan as we had no clue how	Listening, socialism, calm	4	Hacker	No									No	It does not matter what job you get, it matters how you work with your team.	The job I got, Physicist. It is a fun job and you have to manage energy and shoot versa-beams.	Paying attention, calm, listens well.	No	I stayed calm and felt chill.	Yes	If we didn‚Äôt have the teamwork, there is no way we would have lived.	The mission tied directly what we are learning in class as 1. We are learning pollution.  2. We had to try and solve why the fish were dying, from the population.	That that much contamination can wipe a river.

2018/03/20 8:36:45 AM AST	1501569	8th	Contaminant	Changing into a fish.	The beginning was the easiest part.	Towards the end when we saw the fish.	Having more teamwork.	9	8	8	When we all needed to type in the code people from other jobs helped me. Something that decreased my trust was when i wanted to scan people they would decline it and almost died.	When I had to do immediate scans and also keep track of the filters.	When finding the medicine for what was wrong. 	Smart, brave, and outgoing	4	Doctor	No									Yes	I didn‚Äôt know what to do at first.	Hacker seemed interesting and fun.

2018/03/20 9:31:53 AM AST	421544	8th	Contaminant	What I liked most about the mission was being the pilot.	The easiest part of the mission was collecting water samples.	The most difficult part of the mission was fighting off the robot patrol machines.	I think that it needs more communication between the kids and the computers	8	4	7	People not knowing how to do their job made me lose trust.	I had to help the engineer fix most of the problems that contained their job.	A part when I had to be creative was when we had no speed to move we had to use the boosters to get out of the place. 	Communication, confidence, and intelligence.	4	Pilot	Yes	No	I do not because I‚Äôm the future there will be more buttons and would be confusing.	Engineer because I did it before.	Communication 	Yes	Because I have to find where to go	Yes	Because if someone didn‚Äôt do their job another position might be shut down									We have been learning about pollution and how things effect the world.	I have learned that things that shouldn‚Äôt be in the water could make it bad
2018/03/20 9:32:06 AM AST	701103	8th	Contaminant	I liked being able to communicate with other's the most about the mission.	The easiest part of the mission was when no calls were coming in.	The most difficult part of the mission was scanning the water.	I think we could have communicated better in the mission.	7	5	9	I belive trust was held constant throughout the whole mission.	I had to used problem solving skills when figuring out what happened that was killing the fish.	When decrypting the messages I had to be creative in coming up with a solution.	Trustworthy, friendly, strategist	4	Doctor	No									No	Communications was my second choice and I was already experienced in it.	I was interested in pilot because I did it in 6th grade and it was better than answering phone calls.	You would have to be able to answer phone calls and communicate with people.	Yes	The captain was pressuring me to decrypt the message quicker than I was able to.	Yes	It takes a whole team to defeat evil, not just one person.

2018/03/20 9:38:46 AM AST	421476	8th	Contaminant	Working on how to fix the problems in the ship ( floods, fires, etc ).	The easiest part of the mission was going through the streams.	The most difficult part may have been when our group had to scan the water, whereas we had to listen carefully to our directions ; we were also very frantic. 	When speaking the directions for scanning the water, just speak slightly slower.	7	8	10	The pilot didn‚Äôt know where he was going at first, but once they found out where to go ; they were fine. The hacker also didn‚Äôt really know what they were doing and towards the end, he started to not understand anymore.	We had to find out how to protect the fish as we were in combats / fights.	We all had to talk to each other and try our bet to keep the fish as close as possible.	Confidence, able to work together, nice.	4	Deck Chief	Yes	No	Because it didn‚Äôt teach me that much about what happens in real life ; although, it showed me severe problems that can occur.	Biologist because in the future, I used to want to be a vet.	Being able to listen to alarms, paying close attention to what to pick, and scanning certain things.	Yes	I was also telling others where to go during the mission because of the maps that showed on my screen, yet it turned out to be the right way!	Yes	because we all worked together and helped each other as we continued the mission.									We were learning about certain pollutions at the time, so it tied into what we were learning by the water being polluted. It also helped us learn how some animals could die / disappear by pollution.	That many other things, such as our environment / food / shelter could be affected.
2018/03/20 9:41:54 AM AST	701066	8th	Contaminant	I like fixing stuff as an engineer.	The easiest part of the mission was the beginning when one thing broke down.	The most difficult part of the mission was when everyone started shutting down and it was hard to fix it all quick.	We need to communicate more.	10	5	5	My fellow engineer stopped working at some points.	I had to fix the more important stuff first 	When both engineers could work on the same thing at once it could go quicker	They would be nice,they would work with others and they would communicate.	5	Engineers	Yes	No	No because I don‚Äôt plan on being an engineer but it would be nice just Incase my moms car needs fixed	I didn‚Äôt seem interested in anything else 	They would not be easily frustrated 	Yes	At one point everything shut down 	No	Some people didn‚Äôt haft to do anything 									We work as a team in class and we do diffrent jobs	Team work gets he job done

2018/03/20 10:00:09 AM AST	701222	8th	Contaminant	I enjoyed the mission part, working with my team and as a biologist was very fun. 	The easiest part of the mission was finding the fish since they were in our path upstream.	The most difficult part of the mission was trying to defeat the enemy ships, there were a lot them and they were hard to fight.	I think the mission was fine the way it was except the swimming in the river was difficult and our controls broke a lot	10	10	10	An example that helped increase trust between my fellow Infinity Knights was when we all worked togther through out the mission. All the team members worked together in a well manor and that increased my trust. 	We had to use problem solving skills in the mission when we were trying to find out why the fish were gone and only in one area.	During the mission, I had to be creative when we were looking for the reeason why the fish were disappearing.	Three traits a great Infinity Knight should have are resourcefulness, good communication skills, and motivation.	5	Doctor	No									Yes	I really wanted my first choice and I would probably work better with my first choice.	Tactical because I have done that job before and it was really exciting.	They should be well coordinated, have good communication skills, and be well read.	No	I didn't because my job was practically easy.	Yes	Everyone did their job very well and efficiently.	We learned about how pollution is affecting environments and the mission was something similar.	I learned about how pollution can affect the environment and then us humans as well.

2018/03/20 10:23:32 AM AST	421400	8th	Contaminant	I likes the theme of the mission and how we had to find the fish.	The easiest part of the mission was when we had to find the fish.	the most difficult part of the mission is when my group was on the mission was when we had to scan the water.

2018/03/20 10:26:24 AM AST	1500995	8th	Contaminant	What I liked most about the mission was how we were able to sucsedded because we worked as a team	The easiest part of the the mission was the teamwork part of it.	The most difficult part of the mission was the combat.	Nothing, we had a successful mission	10	9	9	The communications and I frequently communicated about the type is water.

The engineer because they were in charge of fixing the ship	Creativeness	Yes	I was responsible for most because I was the captain	Yes	Most jobs were equally important									This tied to thinking out of the box in class and creativeness 	Nothing
2018/03/20 10:26:35 AM AST	1500218	8th	Contaminant	I liked solving all the problems with everyone participating and doing their part. 	The easiest part of the mission was assigning the right medications for the crew members to make everything normal.	The most difficult part of the mission was working together and typing in the correct codes for the water sample.	I think that everyone should pay more attention and work together more.	8	7	5	The captain only worked with the pilot, and the first officer and second officer should have told us what codes to put in a little faster.	If one crew member was sick, i had to figure out he right medication to give them so that everything remained normal.	I had to keep the filtration system steady so that no toxins filled up the air. I picked all kinds of different  filters to remove the toxins.	A great infinity knight trait could be hard-working, cooperative, and attentive.	5	Doctor	Yes	Yes	It is interesting to know about other jobs.	Communications because you can decrypt codes.	You would need to know he alphabet and maybe other languages.	Yes	A crew member can get very unhealthy or I could have damaged a blood cell during a medical emergency.	Yes	Without one of the jobs, the ship could be seen, driven into a wall, going to fast, crew members could get sick, the computer could get hacked, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to shoot, and we wouldn‚Äôt know what rules to follow.									We have been learning about pollution which could be a reason the fish were dying. We were also learning about the water and how fish could die in to cold or hot of water in the ocean. 	I learned that working together is a huge part in completing a mission successfully.
2018/03/20 10:27:50 AM AST	1500951	8th	Contaminant	What I like about this mission was we found the fish.	The easiest part was my station as an engineer there was one part where you had to make ammo and that was very easy.	The most difficult was trying to keep up with everything.	We could work more as a team.	9	6	3	Our pilot started to learn how to control the ship and near the end we started to work better together.	I had to give the percent number to a certain person at some points of the mission.	When I had to control the bars for engineer.	Smart, leadership, good listener	3	Engineers	Yes	No	It was kind of like the security guard job.	Security Guard because I have experienced it before.	They would need to know where everything is for the engineer.	No	It was like the security guard and I knew what to do.	Yes	Everything was part of the mission.									We learned about pollution and animals	I learned how to make the ammo for the gunner.

When I had to fix something in the ship I have to pick which part I need to pick, there is more options that make it a bit difficult.	When I found the sand flies on my sensor I thought that the sand flies could effect us in some way.	Kindness, Confidence, and courage	4	Deck Chief	No									No	Because I can experience more jobs	Doctor because I like environmental stuff and helping others.

2018/03/20 10:31:22 AM AST	1502805	8th	Contaminant	I liked the theme of the mission and how we disguised as a fish most.	The easiest part of the mission was calculating the data that other jobs needed.	The most difficult part of the mission was trying to slow down the ship when we got closer to the fish.	I think we could‚Äôve worked better as a team because a lot of people didn‚Äôt get along with eachother and didn‚Äôt know how to work as a team.	3	4	5	Some people weren‚Äôt listening to me when i asked them to give me the numbers that needed to be calculated so that decreased some of the trust between me and my fellow Infinity Knights.	We had to do a couple water scans which was a situation in which I had to use problem solving skills because nobody was doing the jobs that needed to be done in order to complete the water scans.	I had to come up with a solution to a problem when other positions needed a number calculated.	Three personality traits a great Infinity Knight would have determination, cooperative with others, and patience.	3	Navigator	Yes	Yes	Because i really liked controlling the speed of the ship and working with the pilot.	I was interested in being the physicist because i has that job before and it was fun to control the versabeams.	They would need to be responsible and taking control of the speed.	Yes	Yes because it was hard to do my job when other people weren‚Äôt doing their jobs.	Yes	Everybody needed to do something with their job to get through the mission and get water scans.									This mission had to do with pollution and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre learning class.	I learned that it is hard working with other people who aren‚Äôt very responsible doing their jobs.

2018/03/20 10:40:45 AM AST	1504976	8th	Contaminant	What I liked about the mission was that we found the fish by working as a whole. 	Finding the fish was the easiest part of the mission. 	The most difficult part of the mission was when we had to put numbers in the keypad through different jobs because everyone was doing there own thing.  	I think what should be improved about the mission is, the communication could be better through the computer system. 	7	7	8	The mission was successful but it there was moments when the pilot and the caption were screaming at eachother, and when the engineer wouldn‚Äôt complete his tasks given. 	During the mission, everyone was asking me to help them complete a certain task and I helped them, like when we were losing oxygen I helped the engineer put in the code and the oxygen remained. 	When we found the fish I did not know how to get the fish aboard the ship, then I suggested to ask the commander computer of the ship. 	Bravery, kind, listening skills and working skills. 	5	Pilot	Yes	Yes	It sounds like it would be a really good experience. 	Caption because I feel like I could communicate with people. 	Listening, and paying attention. 	Yes	Everyone was depending on me to complete my tasks given. 	Yes	I believe that every job was critical because everyone was critical to the success of the mission because everyone had to work together to get the fish and add codes in and to get the ship up and running. 									One example is that the population will die of starvation if there is too many people for the food population and if the food is gone, then people will rapidly die. Another example is pollution has effected the water supply extremely, which happens because of global warming. 	I learned that any little thing that has disappeared or has ran out can effect an economy.

2018/03/20 12:06:48 PM AST	1500201	8th	Contaminant	Getting our jobs 	I wasn‚Äôt here	I wasn‚Äôt here	Maybe we could have assigned the better jobs to the more skilled people	6	5	7	We needed a better communications and hacker	I wasn‚Äôt here	We had to try to figure out a new solution once our old one didn‚Äôt work 	Trust, hard work skills, and determination 	4	Biologist	Yes	Yes	It was very interesting 	The hacker because i like working with computers 	Leadership, and knowledge 	No	You don‚Äôt have to meet deadlines	Yes	All of the jobs mattered to be successful 									Water filtration, and survival of the fittest 	I wasn‚Äôt here to complete the mission
2018/03/20 12:07:49 PM AST	Dc1505862	8th	Contaminant	When we attacked people	Flying 	Fixing everything that was broken	Better team work	8	9	10	They told us what we had to do and what was going on	When I had to check fuel	I had to do things at the Same time	Being brave ,talking to there fellow knights, and keeping track of things	5	Second Officer	No									Yes	Yes because I don‚Äôt know how to function everything	Cause I keep track of what I have to do	Communication,kindnes	No	 No Cause I keep things under control	Yes	Yes because they knew what they were doing	Because we had to look at population and pollution 	Teamwork is the best way of communicating 
2018/03/20 12:08:20 PM AST	Dc1505862	8th	Contaminant	When we attacked people	Flying 	Fixing everything that was broken	Better team work	8	9	10	They told us what we had to do and what was going on	When I had to check fuel	I had to do things at the Same time	Being brave ,talking to there fellow knights, and keeping track of things	5	Second Officer	No									Yes	Yes because I don‚Äôt know how to function everything	Cause I keep track of what I have to do	Communication,kindnes	No	 No Cause I keep things under control	Yes	Yes because they knew what they were doing	Because we had to look at population and pollution 	Teamwork is the best way of communicating 
2018/03/20 12:10:41 PM AST	1502255	8th	Contaminant	How we worked as a team	The easiest part of the mission was getting the planet that we had to go to	The hardest part was trying to get the water results to the mayor because we couldn‚Äôt figure it out	I think that the stealing of the ship shouldn‚Äôt be so sensitive	10	10	10	When we were fighting the other ship, we all had to do different things and work together to fight it. 	When we couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get the water sample to the Mayor, so the captains and assistant people went around to every computer and checked them. 	When the people from the chemicals place came for us we just kept going in circles so that they wouldn‚Äôt catch us. 	Leadership, strength, and intelligence	5	Deck Chief	No									No	I was just happy to be in the simulator, it doesn‚Äôt matter that much to me. 	I was interested in being the doctor because I‚Äôm into doing medicine	You kind of have to have common sense because you need to be able to solve problems	No	I don‚Äôt really feel pressure because I know that I‚Äôm gonna get it. 	Yes	Because we were a team and we all have to do something to complete the mission	We were studying pollution and that it what we were trying solve. Also, we were studying air pollution and that was in this a little bit 	That working as a team is the best possible thing in that kind of situation 
2018/03/20 12:15:20 PM AST	1501572	8th	Contaminant	I liked that the crew was communicating a lot and giving info to each other.	Finding the fish and what caused the fish to go away.	Going against the search ship things.	I think they could make some parts easier and some parts harder.	8	9	8	The other engineer didn‚Äôt under some parts of the job so I had to help her.	We had to know which parts of the ship needed most help and fixing.	I fixed the engines so we could excape the seeker ship things.	Communication, Responsibiliti and helping.	4	Engineers	Yes	No	It seems pretty simple and i thought it was more complex.	Doctor because I wanted to try something new.	Knowledge of the most important parts of plane.	Yes	It was hard to fix like 8 systems at the Same time.	Yes	We would need all people to help with mission.									Team work and responsibility 	You need a lot of team work to achieve some thing.
2018/03/20 12:20:12 PM AST	1502735	8th	Contaminant	I liked working with other people. And being successful at the mission	The easiest part was working together. And my part in the mission wasn‚Äôt that hard. 	The most difficult part was people not paying attention. And people not being fast enough. 	"People paying closer attention to the directions the captain is telling them and to what they are supposed to be doing. Is what we can approve. 
"	8	9	9	"concentration and group work could increase or decrease in the mission. 
"	When we had to get the depth of water or the temperature of water. 	When we were going to die,drown. We had to come up with a solution so we survived and didn‚Äôt die. 	Concentration,success,hard working	4	First Office	Yes	Yes	I would want to learn about this job in the future because it would be fun. And now i know somewhat about this job. 	doctor because it would be fun to fix people and help people. When they were sick. 	They would need to have a math degree because you need to do problem solving and math during missions or you need to be successful at working together,paying attention. 	No	No because i was calm and if your calm you are more successful. 	Yes	Yes, every job was contributed to the mission because everybody was doing their job correctly and all the jobs connected to eachother 									It tied to what we were doing it class because we were learning about different organisms. And we recently did a class experiment on water. 	I learned more about what to do when someome is attacking a ship or when you need to protect the ship. 
2018/03/20 12:26:03 PM AST	1500202	8th	Contaminant	I liked how we had to work together, and how everyone relied on each other to help them complete whatever task they had at the time, to reach our goal. 	I thought the easiest part of the mission was too listen to what we were being told by our captain and other crew members. Even though some didn't do as well as others, it was the most easiest task in the mission.	I think the most difficult part of the mission was to get the water samples. Everyone was running around trying to figure out how to do it. When we finally scanned the water, we couldn't find out how to send it to the governor. By the time we did send it to the governor, we had to do another water scan. It was just really confusing and chaotic.	Some students were not taking the mission seriously and that cost us the mission. It was a lot harder then I could have been and if we listened to directions from the captain, or any other crew mate, it would have been less confusing.	8	7	7	I trusted the pilot and navigator to steer our ship in the right direction, and I trusted our captain and communicator to give us important information about the mission.	I was the biologist so I had to use problem solving skills and my knowledge about the mission to create the best crimera possible.	I had to know when and how to launch the the crimera and I was creative when adding all of its abilities to help it along the way.	I think a great Infinity Knight needs to be responsible, brave, and works well with others when completing this mission.	5	Biologist	Yes	Yes	My job seemed really fun and interesting and I would love to learn more about it.	I was interested In being the doctor, because I am really interested in the medical field and want to be a doctor when I am older.	I think a biologist needs to be smart and responsible enough to do their job, and to do it well.	Yes	Even if it wasn't my specific job that needed to do something, I always felt Stressed to complete a certain task before it was too late.	Yes	Every job was important to help complete the mission. 									In science we are currently learning about pollution and causes of pollution. In the mission contaminant, we are doing exactly that, finding the cause of this pollution. 	I have learned it is important to work together to complete a task, or else it might not go as well as it could.
2018/03/20 1:31:39 PM AST	421509	8th	Contaminant	I liked fighting the patrol bots. 	The easiest part was traveling upstream.	The most difficult part was transporting the fish downstream.	I think it should be more complicated to find the fish and travel upstream.	8	8	9	Two examples of trusting others is when the captain helped navigate the ship and when the engineer made the weapons needed fast.	We had to use problem solving skills to capture the fish.	When we had to use the shield to capture the fish.	Teamwork,loud voice, leadership	4	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	Yes	No	Because it won't matter next year and I already know enough about it.	I was interested in biologist because I liked the idea of creating a super animal by  putting DNA into an egg.	They would need to know what is needed for different purposes.	No	There wasn't many deadlines that my position had and the ones that it did were very easy to complete.	Yes	All the positions had to do something to keep the ship running.									It has toxic waste in the river which is like the pollution we are learning about. Also, the mission had a factory creating pollution which is similar to how we are learning about different sources of creating pollution.	I have learned that fish need clean water to live and pollution can cause bad things such as starvation and spread of disease.
2018/03/20 1:32:01 PM AST	1500818	8th	Contaminant	Fishes 	Nothing was easy	Everything 	Communication 	7	3	7	Some people are very talkitive 	The sequencer 	The data collecting 	Team player  Loud      Helping 	2	Engineers	Yes	No	It‚Äôs boring 	gunner it looked cool 	Loud aim 	No	It doesn‚Äôt effect my grade 	No	Some people just sat their									Idk	Team work

2018/03/20 1:35:30 PM AST	701108	8th	Contaminant	Doing my job	Finding the fish	Finding the evidence 	The way our pilot drove 	9	8	8	When the captain was checking on everyone to see if they were able to do their job or help any one of us 	Trying to figure out how to scan the water and finding the evidence 	We never did anything creative 	Kindness, patience, and respect 	5	Communications	Yes	Yes	Communication is key in many situations 	Doctor because I am interested in the medical field 	Respect, and kindness 	Yes	Yes because our mission would not have been very successful 	No	Without one job we would‚Äôve been able to complete the mission. 									We are learning about pollution and there was pollution in the water 	Having great teamwork skills can make you successful
2018/03/20 1:35:33 PM AST	701114	8th	Contaminant	My position even though it wasn‚Äôt the one I wanted	Finding the fish	Doing the river scans	Just go a bit faster	8	7	10	It helped hmwhen the captain communicated well with the engineers to fix the ship	What was causing the river to be polluted	When trying to figure out how to use the scanner at my position	Teamwork and leadership	2	Deck Chief	No									No	Even if I didn‚Äôt get the job I wanted I should still use all of my will to do the job I‚Äôm assigned	First officer	Leadership and communication skills	Yes	Because I at least did not want a complete failur 	Yes	A ship only works when all pieces  are working	Polution 	Never trust one corporation to your biggest food source
2018/03/20 1:36:15 PM AST	1501466	8th	Contaminant	I liked everything about the mission.	There was no easy part for me.	Passing the mission was the most difficult part.	More time to complete the mission.	9	10	9	Everyone in the mission were very helpful and understanding. They all helped me with my position.	Solving the problems when the hacker attacked our ship.	I don‚Äôt know.	A Infinity Knight should have a lot of patience, communication, and trust on their teammates.	5	Hacker	No									Yes	Yes, because I had experience being the hacker so I would know what I was doing better. 	Being the videographer because I love taking pictures/videos.	Skills a person should have are patience, understanding other and communicating.	Yes	Yes because there wasn‚Äôt even time to complete the mission.	Yes	Because there needs to be everyone helping eachother out.	In science class we learned about keeping the environment clean and in the mission we were trying to clean the virus to keep the environment clean/safe.	Our society really needs to do something to help the environment.
2018/03/20 1:36:16 PM AST	432654	8th	Contaminant	fining the fish	fining the fish because there were not hard to find	Defending off the enemies	there was nothing to improved	9	9	9	increase	all over them	When I hacked all the enemies ship to stop the enemies using the weapons	Strength honor compassion	4	Hacker	Yes	No	I do not what to be a person who work with computers	I was not interested in other roles	Respect	No	if i picked a job then i should know what i am doing so if there is a deadline i should be able to get it done in time.

2018/03/20 1:39:13 PM AST	1504544	8th	Contaminant	It got very chaotic which was very challenging.	It was mostly difficult so I would so say no part of the mission.	The further we went upstream, the more hectic and difficult it became.	Have the computer do less and the kids do more.	6	6	4	The gunner and Security Chief positions it seemed like they had little idea what they were doing, but everyone was confused.	We had to find the population of the fish and tell the governor what it was.	We had to ask the computer what the population is.	They have to be loud and clear with the positions such as Communication and Pilot.	4	Captain	Yes	Yes	It was very challenging, I do not think I did very well this mission but in past missions we did good.	Pilot	They need to help other positions when nothing is going on.	Yes	We had to save the fish before time was up and was very hard.	No	Some positions did not really do anything. 									The oil cans were in the ocean so it was polluting the water along with the big factories polluting the air.	We need very strong and clear communication to even come close to completing.
2018/03/20 1:41:24 PM AST	1505025	8th	Contaminant	What I like the most about the mission is trying to find the fish and help the city.	The easiest part of the mission was making sure everyone is healthy .	The most difficult part of the mission for our group is trying to test the water.	I think we can improve our communication.	6	4	5	When the captain communicate with use helped us build trust in him. Are plot had stop the ship and help us when the captain couldn‚Äôt do it by himself. Both of those increase our trust .	I had to use my skill when I have to make sure everything is normal in any position.	We had to be creative when we need the fish to follow us back .	Good communicator, helpful and smart 	4	Doctor	Yes	Yes	I like the job and it would really be useful in the future.	Hacker because I like the job of a hacker and I understand it .	They would need to know what help who .	Yes	I felt pressured when the position talked with me to make sure the healthy.	No	No because some position didn‚Äôt have much to do and they just help each other.									This mission tie with how we effect the environment , and what we can do to stop the pollution.	How of everyday life/ job can harm people and the environment.
2018/03/20 1:45:47 PM AST	1505256	8th	Contaminant	The teamwork and dedication my team put in	Finding the fishes	Combat	Better graphics to make it more realistic	9	8	7	Every position had to trust me as engineer 1 to repair the ship	Repairing the ship needed to solve puzzles fast	Choosing what to repair first	Team player, Courageous , Wise	5	Engineers	Yes	Yes	I want to be an engineer in the future	Tactical I share an experience from video games 	Accurate and courageous	Yes	Everyone needed their equipment to be fixed to carry out their roles	Yes	We all worked together as a team and through that we got the dub(W)									To be a ream player and work with team mates	I am really good with puzzles
2018/03/20 2:22:15 PM AST	701100	8th	Contaminant	It was was fun because I was captain and gunner 	Doing river scans	Fighting the bad dudes 	We could not be detected 	10	10	9	Telling me the right river scans 	To fight Vikasa	To make the animal	"Be good at team work 
Be nice be happy"	4	Captain	No									No	I will always do my job 	Pilot since I like to drive things 	Good with people 	No	I‚Äôll do it when I can	No	Some didn‚Äôt do things for a while 	Trying to conserve pollution 	Pollution is bad for the environment 
2018/03/20 2:23:47 PM AST	701053	8th	Contaminant	How well my team worked together.	Communication with my team.	The most difficult part of the mission was not getting angry.	Our team could‚Äôve stayed calm and not have gotten mad when something went wrong	9	10	8	When the hacker let the system get hacked.	How to make the river scan.	I never had to be creative to come up with a solution to a problem.	Strength,logic, patience 	5	First Office	No									No	I liked the job that i got.	Communications because I have done it before.	Common sense.	No	It was a very laid back job.	Yes	We all had to work together for our mission to be a success.	Vacasa was putting pollution into the air and killing off species.	Keeping the environment clean is critical.
2018/03/20 2:25:24 PM AST	1500802	8th	Contaminant	When we got to fight with the enemy ships.	The easiest part was getting through the river until we ran into the enemy.	Trying to kill all the enemy ships.	To not have as many enemy ships that there where.	8	8	9	The captain didn‚Äôt know much about the mission.	To help finish the water scan.	Making the fish follow us.	Confidence, good at communicating, and having a knowledge of what to do.	5	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	Yes	Yes	It was a fun job	The captain or the second officer because they look like it‚Äôs a big role but it‚Äôs fun.	Confidence,communication,knowledge	No	I don‚Äôt usually get nervous.	Yes	Everyone was doing something 									The global warming because of pollution, and the water was polluted in the mission.	How many things could go wrong from one river being polluted.

2018/03/20 2:27:39 PM AST	1500867	8th	Contaminant	What I liked most about the mission is how we learned how to work together as a team and solve a problem.	The easiest part of the mission was the very beginning before everything went crazy.	The most difficult part of the mission for me (I was the doctor) is when everyone was dying and I had to heal them all at once.	I think that this mission could be improved by having 2 captains because it was very stressful for the captain.	9	8	10	What helped increase my trust is when the pilot got us unstuck and back up and running. What decreases my trust is when the captain could not multitask and help everyone. 	I had to use problem solving skills when everyone was dying. 	I had to be creative when nobody was telling me what to do and I had to figure it out on my own.	A great infinity knight should be good at communicating, hard working, and determined. 	5	Doctor	Yes	Yes	I am very interested in everything involving doctoring and health science. 	I was interested in biologist because biology intrigued me.	They would need to be intelligent and hard-working 	Yes	So many people were dying and I had a limited time to fix them.	Yes	Everyone had an important role in our success as a team 									We have been learning about water and air pollution.	I‚Äôve learned how to work with my team. 
2018/03/20 2:28:42 PM AST	701121	8th	Contaminant	I liked that the mission was fun to do.	The easiest part was working together.	The most difficult part was trying to find everything.	I think we can improve our communication.	9	8	7	Everyone communicating and getting along.	We had to use problem solving to kill off everything.	We had to be creative whenever we almost died.	Smart, helpful and caring.	5	Biologist	Yes	Yes	I think biologist is an interesting job.	I think the captain is an interesting job because thats who communicates with everyone.	You would have to be good at communicating.	No	No because I beleived in us.	Yes	Yes, everyone had a role in it.									The air pollution and killing things off.	I have learned that in a mission communication is the key.
2018/03/20 2:29:57 PM AST	421518	8th	Contaminant	I liked my position as the doctor in my mission.	The sitting in the wheeling chair.	"Having everyone die at the end and sometimes not being able to save them without a time
consuming surgery."	The first officer positions always being filled.	9	9	5	When nobody scanned their hands just to spite me!!	When we had to do the water test and work together to figure it out!	"When giving people
medications i memorized a song to sing."	They would have honor compassion and strength!	5	Doctor	Yes	Yes	I would like to be a murse when i grow up! I think saving lives is pretty cool!	Honestly none of them tickled my sparkle! I am not interested in many things!	They would need to be able to handle stress well! Because everyone dies at the end! ITS STESSFUL!!!	Yes	Because everyone dies no matter what you do! You have to save them! 	Yes	"Team work is critical for this mission because everyone is needed for
secession! Just like in life i would be dead without my mom!"									The pollution issues and how sensitive ecosystems can be.	That fish follows you when you provoke them.
2018/03/20 2:32:56 PM AST	421446	8th	Contaminant	What I liked mostly about the mission was whenever the bar people found us and came after us and we lied to them	The easiest part of the mission was when we had to plant the mines 	Defeating the other robots in the water	I think that you should have more choices to make in the mission 	9	9	8	When we started to mess up and they weren‚Äôt listing I lost trust a little in out infinity knights 	When I had to put the ship at a certain speed 	When I had to have a normal speed on the ship 	Team work communication listening	5	Navigator	No									No	I new what to do and still had fun	Gunnner capitin there fun	Know what there doing the whole time	Yes	Cause if I made he shipnto fast we would crash	No	Each had a part for us to beat the mission	Stuff that we learbed	Team work makes a dream work üòÇ
2018/03/20 2:33:10 PM AST	421528	8th	Contaminant	It was fun and I liked the story line. 	The easiest part of the mission was finding the fish.	The most difficult part of the mission was finding the factory and defeating the sandflies	We could have worked together a little better. We also could have took it more seriously. 	9	9	8	We all communicated and worked pretty well together. We also all listened to each others ideas and opinions.	We as a team had to use problem solving skills when we had to try to find the factory. 	When we had to be creative to come up a solution when we were trying to find the fish.	"good communication skills
good problem solving skills
outgoing
"	4	Hacker	Yes	Yes	Yes, because it is very interesting and I feel that I have the skills that it takes.	The communications officer because it seems like an intersting and fun job to have and decoding messages sounds fun	"outgoing
good communication skills
good computer skills"	Yes	Yes because one of the other jobs needed me to do something in order for them to continue their job.	Yes	Yes because every job is important and has an important job.									It tied in with our science class because we are learning about pollution. We are also learing about humans in the environment.	The many things can suffer from just a little pollution. 
2018/03/20 2:33:25 PM AST	1501743	8th	Contaminant	What was causing pollution 	When we had to check if the water is polluted 	Fighting the robots it was very difficult because they were moving very fast	Nothing	9	9	10	Increase because I have done  this 3 times.Doing it the therd time I was use to what is going on	Knowing we‚Äôre we were going	When we were out of energy 	Helpful,be specific,and worktogath	5	Engineers	Yes	Yes	Because I want to be a engineer 	Biology because I like science 	Need to know how to work together 	Yes	Because when you have the job of being engineer you need to fix many thing at the same time	Yes	Because you need  many people to eachieve something  									We have been learning about pollution.we also learned about how to solve problems if you don‚Äôt know many things	You need to work with everyone 
2018/03/20 2:34:04 PM AST	421493	8th	Contaminant	i liked the end when we realized we succeeded and we all were excited 	the easiest part of the mission was the beginning. it was easy because nothing intense or crazy was happening.	the most difficult part was when the enemies found us and came after us. it was very stressful because we have done to do a lot of things at once. 	there should be more then one captian. we need to have more people in charge to run the ship to avoid as much chaos.	9	8	7	i worked very well with my communications officer and my doctor. when they needed help i was there to help them and they were there to help me. also when we needed to scan the water we worked well together 	we used problem solving skills when we needed to decript a message or learn new things about our mission	we had to be creative when all of our other solutions didn‚Äôt work to solve a specific problem 	three good traits would be determination, kindness, and focus	5	Deck Chief	Yes	No	i do not want to be that when i grow up 	i was also interested in doctor because i wanted to have that responsibility 	they would need to be able to stay focused and work hard.	Yes	i wanted to stay focused and get things done as quickly as possible	Yes	everyone had an important rule in order to succeed the mission 									it tided in with biology and solving problems	i learned that every job is important to solve a problem 
2018/03/20 2:34:22 PM AST	701061	8th	Contaminant	The thing that I liked most about the mission was fighting off the bots in order to not die and get the fish.	The easiest part of the mission was finding the fish in the water and getting them into the ship.	Even though it was my favorite part of the mission fighting off the bots was very difficult too.	Something that could be improved about the mission could be maybe knowing that you found the fish because you didn't really know if you went past them yet during the mission.	9	10	9	Something that increased the trust was when the captain would tell me something that I would need to do and I would get it done.	We had to use problem solving when fighting off the bots in the mission.	We had to be creative when trying to gets fish when we were being attacked by the bots.	They should be creative, confident, and have common sense.	5	First Office	No									No	No because as long as I was a part of the mission it didn't matter.	I seem interested in first officer because I wanted the responsibility of helping others and being mote in charge.	They would need to be very confident and be very good at working with others.	No	No because I would get them done very fast and would be on top of all of my other things.	Yes	Yes because we all worked together to get it done.	It tied in with how we are learning about population and how different tings can affect one another.	Something new that I have learned is that it is very important to communicate with others during group work.
2018/03/20 2:37:08 PM AST	421446	8th	Contaminant	What I liked mostly about the mission was whenever the bar people found us and came after us and we lied to them	The easiest part of the mission was when we had to plant the mines 	Defeating the other robots in the water	I think that you should have more choices to make in the mission 	9	9	8	When we started to mess up and they weren‚Äôt listing I lost trust a little in out infinity knights 	When I had to put the ship at a certain speed 	When I had to have a normal speed on the ship 	Team work communication listening	5	Navigator	No									No	I new what to do and still had fun	Gunnner capitin there fun	Know what there doing the whole time	Yes	Cause if I made he shipnto fast we would crash	No	Each had a part for us to beat the mission	Stuff that we learbed	Team work makes a dream work üòÇ
2018/03/20 2:39:11 PM AST	1504315	8th	Contaminant	Something I liked the most about the mission was the story line. 	The easiest part of the mission was telling the governor information that we found in the waters. 	The most difficult part of the mission was keeping up with all the problems happening in the ship. 	Somethings I think could be improved on the mission was the time it takes to scan the waters because it took five minutes just to get one scan completely done. 	10	9	8	I thought the engineers were going to be a lot slower than they actually were and I thought the hacker would slack off, but ended up doing very well in fixing and stopping the computers.	A situation during the mission in which we had to use problem solving skills is when the fertiliser incorporation was onto our disguise as a fish. 	A situation during the mission where we had to be creative was when the fertiliser incorporation sent their robots to keep us from finding the pollution they are dumping in the river. 	Honour, compassion, strength 	5	First Office	No									No	I still got a job that was fun to do and I wouldn't risk failing the mission just because I didn't like the job I had. 	Another role I seemed interested in was engineer. 	Skills that a person had to of had for this job was to focus and to know what they are doing in a timely matter. 	No	The job as communications was pretty simple an it was easy to do because I had to deliver the correct information to the captain so he could tell the govenor. 	Yes	If there are positions not filled it would be very difficult to have a successful mission. 	This mission tied into what we were learning in class bwcause we were learning about pollution and how it effects the environments, we were also learning about the sixth extinction and how we are effecting that extinction. 	Something new that I had learned from completing the mission was that when water is polluted sandflies will appear an live there. 
2018/03/20 3:44:57 PM AST	1503647	8th	Contaminant	I liked the fact that we had our own jobs, but had to work together to fulfill them.	The easiest part of the mission was when we got to take the fish back.	The hardest part was when we had to take water samples.	We could be given more information on what to do instead of wasting large amounts for time figuring things out ourselves.	8	8	8	The hacker had to communicate with me a lot but did not.	Figuring out how to resolve security issues.	Upon using the codes I discovered to dispatch security teams.	Loyalty, trust, and perseverance	5	Videographer	No									No	I had previous experience with the job I was given.	Videographer because I love filmography.	A protective manner	Yes	I did because we came out successful in the time we were given.	Yes	I was lucky to be gifted with a hardworking and collected team.	During class, we have been learning about the sixth extinction and how we are causing it. Pollution is the avid reason for global warming, as it was for the health crisis and missing fish in the Contaminant Mission.	Even though it is our fault for polluting the earth, it isn‚Äôt too late to change our old habits.
2018/03/20 4:28:08 PM AST	421372	8th	Contaminant	I like the background of the mission. I like that we are trying to uncover a hidden secret. 	The easiest part of the mission would probably be fixing all the floods, fires etc 	The difficult part would have to be getting away from the ships with very little oxygen left. 	I think are ability to talk to each other more could be better 	8	6	7	My fellow infinity knights didn‚Äôt hesitate to come over and help me when I was stuck on something. They also worked as fast as possible when me along with other needed more computer capacity. 	When the fish were trailing behind us and we needed to make sure they followed us out. We had to move slowly and were already really low on oxygen. 	When the water was contaminated we had to come up ways to clean and improve the water	A great infinity night should have good work ethic, the ability to work as fast as possible, and to have teamwork. 	5	Deck Chief	Yes	No	I‚Äôve already done this job before and I think I am pretty good at it 	The communication role  seemed interesting and that would have been a job I would have liked to have done it 	I think they would have to be very on top of things and always watching for things to go wrong. & when they do being very fast and efficient at fixing the problem 	No	I was very comfortable with my job so it wasn‚Äôt very easy to get things done	Yes	I believe that every job had just as much to do with it because everyone needed each other to complete the mission successfully 									We have been learning about how much the things we do on an everyday basis can effect the earth tremendously. This tied in with the mission because we were trying to uncover a hidden problem that‚Äôs been causing people to get extremely ill	I‚Äôve learned that you should really watch what your doing and how much it‚Äôs affecting the earth. And try to cut out daily things that are bad for the earth 
2018/03/20 4:28:40 PM AST	929036	8th	Contaminant	When we had to destroy the fertilizer plant.	When we survy the river.	Destroying the bots in the river.	Nothing can be in proved.	9	9	10	When the captian tells you what to do when we survey the river.	When we survey the river.	When we had to destroy the bots.	We were strong ,nice and helpful as one.	4	Security Chief	Yes	Yes	I want to be a police officer when I grow up.	Security guard because I want to be in the military.	Stragitest is one of the things to be in real life.	No	No because every one helped one another.	Yes	Yes because every job had to do something.									We were learning about pollution and how to stop pollution.	That fertilizer plants can cause pollution.
2018/03/20 4:28:41 PM AST	1504444	8th	Contaminant	find fish.	water	finding the fish and kill them.	done the mission.	6	5	5	"find fish and kill them

2018/03/20 5:31:15 PM AST	421519	8th	Contaminant	The teamwork was awesome.	The rivers were easy to navigate.	In the end, there were many emiemes that, for a moment, trapped us.	The biologist had little to do on the mission. I think we should have controlled the water scans.	10	8	6	The doctor was not doing his job, not scanning anybody. This decreased my trust in the doctor.	I hadn‚Äôt used problem solving in this mission.	I didn‚Äôt have to.	I good Knight would be brave, determined, kind, and honorable.	5	Doctor	No									No	I easily completed the biologist‚Äôs job and enjoyed it.	I was interested in the first officer role because I love to help people.	They should be quick thinking, intelligent, and nice.	No	My job was fairly easy.	Yes	We had to work together to scan the water and do other tasks.	We are learning about pollution and the industries that create the pollution.	I honestly hadn‚Äôt learned anything new from this mission.
2018/03/20 6:03:08 PM AST	421390	8th	Contaminant	the teamwork	the easiest part of the mission was finding the fish 	the most difficult part was when you fought the corporation	the engineer being stronger the engineer position is very weak 	6	4	10	the fact that a majority of the positions went up too the first officer to see the positions since we did not have a first officer. also the tactician not killing the enemies.	I dont think we got to a point where we need that.	one part where we had to be creative was when we had to figure out what the missions we had to do to move on.	Three personality traits best to have are communication,trust, and not putting blame on others.	4	Engineers	Yes	Yes	because engineer is intriguing  where i can understand whats happening like in science i can learn about the basics of life and atoms to know how everything works 	i was also interested in the first officer telling people what to do and being a successor to the captain	one skill would be being able to multi task so you can complete  everything and work fast 	Yes	because if you don't get that certain thing fixed fast enought the whole ship will feel that effect so the team heavily relies on you 	Yes	everything is just a unit with little things doing there job to complete the larger picture more than them selves "Emergence"									the polloutin in the water and the fish causing more sand flys 	how one animal and polloution can effect an envoirment
2018/03/20 7:03:25 PM AST	1505025	8th	Contaminant	What I like the most about the mission is when we were trying to find the fish.	The easiest part of the mission was making sure everyone was healthy.	"The most difficult part of the mission was we tried to test the water and send the report to the city.
"	Something that can be improved in the mission is how we communicate.	8	4	8	Our trust increased when the caption went and tried to help everyone. Also when our pilot would stop and help out other people when the caption couldn't.	knowing the different types of pill help me.	I had to come up with a solution when everything in the body wasn't normal so I had to come up with a solution.	Good communicator, helpful and smart 	5	Doctor	Yes	Yes	I would like the undertake this role because I really how it works.	Hacker because I now how the job works and I understand it better	I think they would have to be smart and understand how different things work.	Yes	I felt pressure when other position how table with their health and I couldn't help them all.	No	we had some job the didn't need anyone to work on because it was not needed 									We were learning about pollution in our environment and ho we can stop pollution.	Most of our actions effect the environment.
2018/03/21 6:28:49 AM AST	22bistaa	8th	Contaminant	It was exciting solving everything.	The easiest part was staying underwater.	The difficult part was finding the fish.	You can make it easier.	5	5	7	Everyone was trying to achive the same goal.	I don‚Äôt remember a suition like that.	When it told us to talk to the computer.	Three traits are bravery, itenglence.	4	Deck Chief	No									Yes	It affected it because I did not know how to do the job.	I wanted to do the role I alreadey knew how to do.	I think that person would need leadership skills.	No	It just felt like a game so I didn‚Äôt feel a lot of pressure.	Yes	All the jobs was connected to eachother.	What we are learning is class has something to do with pollution and so does the mission.	Nothing new.
2018/03/21 7:09:13 PM AST	yn1505108	8th	Contaminant	 Working together with others	 Finding the fishes 	 Everything was easy 	 We got experience 	4	5	9	 Working hard 	Nth 	Idk 	 We got  experiments we got to learn how to work with a team 	3	Biologist	Yes	Yes	 I want to know more about it 	 Captain  because I want to learn how to lead people 	 Captain 	Yes	Idk 	Yes	 Because  lots of  people life are dependent on us 									Water pollution	 How much important is working with the team 
2018/03/22 9:05:51 AM AST	934114	8th	Contaminant	How we all worked together and completed the mission	Whenever we just had to go to the places where we had to scan	Whenever the corporation started firing at us	We could've done better whenever we were attacked	8	7	6	Whenever people where communicating with eachother and trying to figure out problems	Whenever i had to decrypt messages	Whenever i could not figure out how to decrypt messages	Braveness nobleness and kindness	4	Communications	Yes	No	Because i just felt like the role did not fit me	Engineer because i feel as if that is the best role to fit my skills	They need be social not shy kind and aware	Yes	Because i do not wanna fail anyone	Yes	Because without teamwork and everyones help we wouldn't have been able to do it									It taught us about science teamwork and responsibility	That teamwork is very important in life
2018/03/22 10:50:54 AM AST	1500995	8th	Contaminant	It was a great learning experience	The easiest part was knowing we're to go	The hardest part was the testing of the water	What can be improved is the job assignments	10	10	10	During combat and when talking to the computer	When we found out who was polluting the river	How to capture the fish	Creativeness, Open-minded, and teamwork	5	Captain	Yes	Yes	It was a fun time	The pilot cause you got to drive	Leadership skills	Yes	I was the captain of the ship 	Yes	Every helped in the end									Water quality and thinking outside the box 	Nothing

It was pollution and that is what we are learning 	Companies may be doing wrong without you knowing
2018/03/22 12:37:39 PM AST	421498	8th	Contaminant	It was not too easy, it was challenging. 	Taking the water samples. 	Going downstream when being attacked. 	It should be more clear on what to do from the beginning. 	7	6	6	It helped me trust that the engineers when we were being attacked they fixed the engines. 	I had to figure out how to get out of danger when the engines were down. 	I had to be creative when we were stuck being attacked. 	Honor compassion and strength 	3	Pilot	Yes	No	It is not an intrest to me. 	I was interested in captain because i liked the idea of being in control. 	Focus and control. 	No	It was easy. 	Yes	We all had to work to help eachother. 									It ties into how we learn about pollution and our teamwork skills when we work together. 	Teamwork is important.

2018/03/22 2:09:09 PM AST	1505927	8th	Contaminant	I think the most like about the mission is to help fish to get out of the pollution 	to find the fish and keep them safe from pollution 	to find fish and keep them safe 	i think yes because we work really hard 	2	5	7	"To get the fish out

2018/03/22 5:08:48 PM AST	1505799	8th	Contaminant	The thing I liked most about the mission was the story line And when we had to hide so the enemy wouldn‚Äôt find us	The easiest was turning into the fish and going underwater 	The difficult part was staying hidden from the enemy. We couldn‚Äôt even go slightly above water or they would have found us	Teamwork	8	6	5	When the deck chief and I were helping each other with our position 	When the enemy found us and started attacking multiple members health was declining, so I had to work as fast as I would to increase the health of the crew members and prevent them from dying.

It causes global warming which is really terrible for earth 	I don‚Äôt seem to remember 
2018/03/22 5:23:24 PM AST	701155	8th	Contaminant	I like that I got to work as a team with my class mates	The easiest part was answering calls since I was communications.	The difficult part was lying to Vikasa.	I don't think anything needed to be improved.	9	9	6	I think something that helped increase my trust is the fact that we got our engines working when they were down and that we caught the fish and got the water samples. 	One situation when I had to problem solve is when we had to lie to Vikasa.	I don't think there were any times when I had to do that.	I think three personality traits would be hard- working, problem- solver, and reliable.	4	Communications	Yes	Yes	Yes, because I feel like it would be good to be more educated in this situation/subject.	I think the engineers because it was really neat how they were able to get the engines back up and running after they had failed a lot of times.	The captain(boss)	No	No, because my job as communications was easy and I was able to decrypt the messages fast.	Yes	I believe everyone had a good role in this situation to help succeed at our mission.									One example would be how we had to figure out what polluted the water and another example is what caused the fish to get diseased depending on their habitat.	Something new I learned is that  working with my class mates wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.
2018/03/22 7:01:40 PM AST	1500690	8th	Contaminant	i was not here for the mission	everything was the easiest because i had to do nothing	nothing was the most difficult	nothing	4	5	9	The Pilot doesnt know how to be a pilot and it helped me increase my trust when people started to work together	when their was a problem i had to contact the captain	i never got creative	to be kind, alerted, and be helpful	4	Security Guard	Yes	Yes	yes because i need to improve in my skill of being a security guard	engineer because it seems to be hard working	they need to be very hard working	No	no because my position doesnt do much	Yes	yes because everyone was helpful									idk	idk
2018/03/22 8:44:35 PM AST	421448	8th	Contaminant	I liked how we got to blow up Vikasas Factory	The easest part of the mission was going up stream	The most difficult part was trying to stay on target with the enemy ships	I think our teamwork could be improved	9	9	9	The captains communitcation and the computer system helping us increased between my fellow infinity knights.	When Vikasa spotted us on there radar 	When Vikasa saw us on there radar 	Trust worthy, Bravery, and responsibility 	4	Pilot	Yes	No	Because it is a good thing to know in life. 	tactical because it looked exciting.	I feel they would need a steady hand and watch there surroundings. 	Yes	It was sometimes stressful when we had no engine speed.	Yes	with out all the jobs we probably would have lost the mission.									we needed the water levels and why the animals couldn't live in the water.	I learned that you cant always trust a corroboration, even if they give you something in return.
2018/03/22 9:57:45 PM AST	1502998	8th	Contaminant	What I liked most about the mission is the story behind the mission and when we were on the mission working as a team.	The easiest part for me was making sure everyone was healthy and cared for on board.	The most difficult was keeping up with the water scans and communications with the governor.	What could have been improved during the mission was our ability to listen to one another to create an easier mission.	5	3	6	The pilot during the mission lost my trust at some points because he?she was always flying out of the water and getting us caught Along with the hacker who didn't handle anything during the mission I had to get up and do it, they lost my trust.	A situation where I as an individual had to problem solve was when any of the crew members were sick or injured and I have to solve the problem by finding the right medications to stablize each of their vitals.	I had to be creative in coming up with the medications to heal the injured and ill on board.	"A good quality to have is bravery and trust during a mission because if you are 
not brave and trusting in your team to make right decisions, the mission could fail easily."	3	Doctor	Yes	No	No because I am not interested in moving into a field of human health medicine.	I was interested in biologist because I am super creative and I am very interested in genetics of animals.	They would need to know how genetics work.	No	No, because if you feel pressure you are afraid.	Yes	Every job was critical because every job had an importance in completing the mission, without every job w would have chaos.									This mission tied into our pollution and global warming unit.	I learned about the effects of pollution on people and animals.
2018/03/23 8:39:15 AM AST	421485	8th	Contaminant	It helped us work together 	Using our stations	When our ship was being hacked	Maybe make more things you have to do	8	8	10	When we had to help each other with our stations and when the doctor helped everyone	When we were being hacked and I needed to counter the enemy computer.	When the ship was losing power we need to fix it. 	To work together well, to communicate well, and to be able to listen clearly.	4	Hacker	Yes	Yes	Because I want to work with computers and technology	The gunner because it seemed like I was able to do it	Good eyesight	No	Because I was able to understand every thing about it.	Yes	Because we all worked as a team to finish the mission 									We needed to figure out why there was so much pollution in the water and we're learning about how pollution is caused	To work with others together
2018/03/23 8:43:08 AM AST	421422	8th	Contaminant	I like the big fight at the end	Scanning the river	Stopping the virus	More communicating to evryone	9	8	10	The gunner had loads of ammo ready for a fight	Shooting the ships	"Upgrading the shield

2018/03/23 8:45:00 AM AST	tp0421379	8th	Contaminant	I liked everything like working together to flying the ship 	I was the pilot so flying was pretty easy 	Finding the fish and fighting 	There was not a lot of action 	9	9	8	The captain was the best role they kept us on task to complete the mission. And we gave each other our numbers to do the thing and that took communication. 	We needed to find the fish and find out what was poluting the water so that took skills 	We had to when we were fighting the evil ships 	"Trust 
Team work 
And effort "	4	Pilot	Yes	Yes	The pilot was fun because I get to skurt around and they need a pilot 	Engineer, because they need to basically get the ship in good health 	Good communication skills 	No	I just get us where we need to go	Yes	Because without those jobs we could not have seen where we need to go our communicate with the people we needed to 									Since we were learning about pollution it tied right in 	Really nothing

2018/03/23 8:57:29 AM AST	Destiny Johnson	8th	Countdown	My part of the mission.	The easiest part was the second officer because you really don't do anything.

2018/03/23 10:35:36 AM AST	421548	8th	Contaminant	I liked how we worked together as a team 	The easiest part of my mission was supplying ammo to the gunner	The most difficult was trying to repair the ships defenses 	If they increase the speed of the robot cause that was the main problem 	9	10	9	For example I trusted them when they were doing there job correctly in the warm up but I lost trust when they did not that well in the mission 	I had to repair the ships defenses so me and my partner had to spilt it up and call it out 	When we were repairing the ships defenses 	Team oriented perserverance and determination 	3	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	No									No	Because I was used to be engeneer anyways 	Biologist because I wanted to create the chimera 	U would have to have prior knowledge of the animals to choose to be in the chimira 	Yes	Because I had to repair stuff fast to get the systems back up 	Yes	Cause every job had their part to play in the succession	We were learning about pollution and that are secondary goal was to find out where the most pollution Was 	That if u see sandflys that means there is pollution nearby 
2018/03/23 10:42:33 AM AST	701142	8th	Contaminant	I liked that i was able to drive the ship to where we needed to go	flying the ship upstream 	fighting the security ships	work better together	4	4	9	we didn‚Äôt work together so we lost trust in eachother	when are computers went down we had to use skills to figure out what way to go	when are computers went down	determination, trustworthy, team worker	4	Navigator	No									No	because i got my second choice job	pilot because i‚Äôve never been pilot and i thought i would be pretty good at it	focus and determination because if you fail when being a pilot it could have a serious effect 	Yes	everyone was yelling at me because i was going the wrong way	Yes	everyone had to work together to complete the mission 	you needed to know about pollution and how to fix it	you need to work together as a team to complete challenges 
2018/03/23 11:23:00 AM AST	421443	8th	Contaminant	What I liked most about this mission was the teamwork we had to have to be able to complete this challenging task and be successful in doing so.	The easiest part of the mission, being the engineer, was making ammo.	The most difficult part of the mission, was making sure all the systems of the ship were being fixed quickly so the ship can function.	I think a longer mission and deeper storyline would help improve the mission.	9	9	8	When our group had to scan the water, each person had to read off certain codes to another person to be typed in, I think our group worked very well and was able to complete the scan efficiently, which increased my trust.	Since I was the engineer, when having to complete one of the pattern sequences I had to use problem solving skills.	When we had to fix parts of the mission I had to complete patterns, pull levers and push buttons to fix the ship.	"Honor 
Compassion
Strength"	4	Engineers	Yes	Yes	Yes, because my dad is a computer engineer, and after experiencing being an engineer on this mission it definitely interests me.	Captain, because I like being a leader and practicing leadership roles.	To be an engineer you need to be intelligent and creative, and to be a captain, you have to have leadership and communication skills, but also have to be smart.	Yes	Because if the ship is not functioning and the systems are failing then that is my fault, which is bad.	Yes	Every job was needed to complete this mission, without all the help from each person, this mission would have been much more difficult to complete.									Firstly, we have been learning about pollution in class and this mission directly involves this. Also, we have been discussing how people being wasteful can hurt our environment and this mission shows that.	I learned how negatively our bad, wasteful actions can hurt our world and even other species.
2018/03/23 1:44:23 PM AST	421412	8th	Contaminant	It was challenging but not too fast pace.	Not having to deal with any puzzles on the ipad.	Trying to get everyone to listen to what they were told before the mission failed. 	The mission could‚Äôve lasted a little longer. 	8	7	7	Whenever i was ordered to make sure a certain position did their job they didn‚Äôt listen the first two or three times i explained. 	When helping out the engineer and the security chief the tasks they had to complete included problem solving skills such as quick thinking. 	Whenever we were being directed through the river flow we almost failed the mission so we have to quickly come up with a plan by increasing the velocity of our ship to get out before we died. 	Hard work, cooperation and teamwork 	4	Engineers	No									No	The job i got was my second choice i didn‚Äôt really care what i got. 	only engineer because i knew what i was doing 	A person acting in this job woukd need to have a lot of cooperation or communication in order for the mission to be successful.	No	It wasn‚Äôt hard of a task. 	No	there were a few  people who got a job and did nothing the whole mission because nothing was assigned. 	We were learning about what humans are doing to the environment and the containment in the water was an effect of human interaction. 	Human industries badly effect the water and organisms living in the water.
2018/03/23 9:08:42 PM AST	421451	8th	Contaminant	I liked the end because we found out we succeeded 	The easiest was repairing things at the beginning because there was low demand 	The most difficult part was when we were getting shot at	It could be longer and more specific on what exactly we are doing	10	10	10	We gave accurate information to each other 	We had to figure out how to get to the flies so we decided to look in polluted water 	There were a lot of tasks for engineers so we decided that one would make ammo and the other would repair 	Intelligence Communication Problem-solving	4	Engineers	Yes	Yes	I enjoyed participating as an engineer	First officer because I believe it would be fun to carry out specific orders 	"They would have to be a good listener and communicate well with each other
"	No	I felt like everything was taken care of	Yes	Without the smallest job, there could be big damage done to the mission									We we learning about disease and how it could effect humans and where they live and the mission was exactly about that	Sometimes whoever works together better succeeds 
2018/03/26 9:00:38 AM AST	1505860	8th	Contaminant	I liked when we went out of the water and went back in it was funny because we did not lose the fish	Finding the fish	Getting the fish to the location	How you ask if the water is contaminated 	7	9	9	They have do e this the last two years and this was my 1st time	When we had to give each other the numbers 	Yes because some parts were hard	Brave strong careful 	4	Engineers	No									No	Because it was my first time	Tactical because the action 	Not be pressured or scared to shoot	No	Because my job was easy	Yes	If i didnt do my job no one else could do their job because my job was to basically keep the ship running 	If stuff was contaminated or not	How water can get contaminated

2018/03/26 9:08:55 AM AST	1503014	8th	Contaminant	I liked the whole mission 	I think working with the group was the easiest part 	There wasn‚Äôt really a part hard part of the mission 	Patience 	10	10	10	I wasn‚Äôt there so I really don‚Äôt know 	Finding the fish 	I don‚Äôt know 	You need to have patience can work with others and u have to be nice	5	Tactical (formerly Gunner)	Yes	No	No because I want to be a model in the future or a volleyball player	Doctor 	You need to be caring 	No	I don‚Äôt know 	Yes	I don‚Äôt know									I don‚Äôt know 	I don‚Äôt know

2018/03/26 9:40:51 AM AST	701066	8th	Contaminant	I liked being engineer 	The easiest part was fixing stuff	The hardest part wears when things broke down at once 	If everyone communicated better 	6	5	5	When we worked together people helped 	I had to use this when everything broke down at once 	When everything broke down I had to help the second engineer 	He would helped others, he would communicate well and not  adult be frustrated 	3	Engineers	Yes	Yes	Yes because I might work on a car one day 	Engineer 2 because it‚Äôs still an engineer 	They would need to communicate well 	Yes	When everything breaks down other people‚Äôs stuff stops working 	Yes	There was a kid that had to do one thing 									IN class we work as a team sometimes 	To work with others 
2018/03/26 9:44:06 AM AST	701179	8th	Contaminant	How easy my job was	My job I was the security guard 1	Everyone was screaming 	Everyone can not scream next time	1	3	1	The pilot didn't know what he was doing 	When I had to find the hackers and kill it	Find Short cuts in the maze	Friendly good at communicating and smart	2	Security Guard	Yes	No	I had it last year so already knew what to do	Pilot because it was the only fun role	Not crash a million times	No	I personally didn't like the mission	No	We should have failed but somehow we completed it 									We learned about asexual reproduction and that's what the viruses were doing	Nothing the mission was pointless in my opinionüëç
2018/03/26 9:45:41 AM AST	421510	8th	Contaminant	The teamwork aspect	Traveling down stream taking water tests	Fighting vicossa corporations 	The action in the begging of the mission	8	6	6	When the hacker hacked the enemy it made me trust him more. When the pilot did some fancy driving in the water it made me trust him more.	Figure out where the pollutant was coming from.	When we had to figure out how to beat vicossa	Compassion, strength, courage 	4	First Office	No									No	Because ether way I was going to try my best 	engineer because I had done it before and same with security guards	Smarts, strength, and be able to socialize well	Yes	Because for water scans you always had to do something confusing 	No	All position contributed equally	We learned polution and Bactria which were both major factors in this mission	Teamwork makes a dream work

2018/03/26 2:31:13 PM AST	1505843	8th	Contaminant	I liked most that we worked as a team, blend in with the fish, and we got to find the fish. 	The easiest part of the mission was probably when we had to test the water because all we really had to do was sit there. 	The most difficult part was when we had to beat the enemies and destroy them.	I dont think anything should be improved I think it is interesting and fun the way it is	8	7	10	1 thing that decreased the trust between me and my fellow engineer is whenever my iPad screen was locked and he wasnt paying attention so didnt fix many of our things.	I had to use problem solving skills when we had to find the factory, and find the fish.	We had to be creative when blowing up the factory. 	Determination, hardworking, wiseness	4	First Office	No									No	I do not think that this affected how I did my job because I was still happy to be in there and working with my friends. No matter what I did, I liked it.	Doctor. I was interested because I think that I would be capable of performing surgeries when needed, and taking scans. 	I think they would need to be responsible, mature, and trustworthy.	Yes	I felt pressure to meet the expectations because I have never done it before, and I just wanted to make sure I helped my team not bring them down and fail.	Yes	I do believe that every job plays a part in this mission, and helped us succeed.	We have been learning about taking care of our earth, and that showed us what happens when we dont care for our earth.	Something new that I learned in this mission was about the pollution in the water and how sick it can really make you
